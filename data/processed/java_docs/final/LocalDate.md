# Class LocalDate
public final class LocalDate
extends Object
implements Temporal, TemporalAdjuster, ChronoLocalDate, Serializable
A date without a time-zone in the ISO-8601 calendar system,
such as `2007-12-03`.
`LocalDate` is an immutable date-time object that represents a date,
often viewed as year-month-day. Other date fields, such as day-of-year,
day-of-week and week-of-year, can also be accessed.
For example, the value "2nd October 2007" can be stored in a `LocalDate`.
This class does not store or represent a time or time-zone.
Instead, it is a description of the date, as used for birthdays.
It cannot represent an instant on the time-line without additional information
such as an offset or time-zone.
The ISO-8601 calendar system is the modern civil calendar system used today
in most of the world. It is equivalent to the proleptic Gregorian calendar
system, in which today's rules for leap years are applied for all time.
For most applications written today, the ISO-8601 rules are entirely suitable.
However, any application that makes use of historical dates, and requires them
to be accurate will find the ISO-8601 approach unsuitable.
This is a value-based
class; programmers should treat instances that are
equal) as interchangeable and should not
use instances for synchronization, or unpredictable behavior may
occur. For example, in a future release, synchronization may fail.
The `equals` method should be used for comparisons.
Implementation Requirements:
:   This class is immutable and thread-safe.

+ ### ofInstant
public static LocalDate ofInstant(Instant instant,
ZoneId zone)
Obtains an instance of `LocalDate` from an `Instant` and zone ID.
This creates a local date based on the specified instant.
First, the offset from UTC/Greenwich is obtained using the zone ID and instant,
which is simple as there is only one valid offset for each instant.
Then, the instant and offset are used to calculate the local date.

:   `DateTimeException` - if the epoch day exceeds the supported date range
+ ### from
public static LocalDate from(TemporalAccessor temporal)
Obtains an instance of `LocalDate` from a temporal object.
This obtains a local date based on the specified temporal.
A `TemporalAccessor` represents an arbitrary set of date and time information,
which this factory converts to an instance of `LocalDate`.
The conversion uses the `TemporalQueries.localDate()`) query, which relies
on extracting the `EPOCH_DAY` field.
This method matches the signature of the functional interface `TemporalQuery`
allowing it to be used as a query via method reference, `LocalDate::from`.
Parameters:
:   `temporal` - the temporal object to convert, not null

+ ### isSupported
public boolean isSupported(TemporalField field)
Checks if the specified field is supported.
This checks if this date can be queried for the specified field.
If false, then calling the `range`),
`get`) and `with(TemporalField, long)`)

or for some other reason, an exception is thrown.
If the field is a `ChronoField` then the query is implemented here.
The `supported fields`) will return
appropriate range instances.
All other `ChronoField` instances will throw an `UnsupportedTemporalTypeException`.

+ ### get
public int get(TemporalField field)
Gets the value of the specified field from this date as an `int`.
This queries this date for the value of the specified field.
The returned value will always be within the valid range of values for the field.
If it is not possible to return the value, because the field is not supported
or for some other reason, an exception is thrown.
If the field is a `ChronoField` then the query is implemented here.
The `supported fields`) will return valid
values based on this date, except `EPOCH_DAY` and `PROLEPTIC_MONTH`
which are too large to fit in an `int` and throw an `UnsupportedTemporalTypeException`.
All other `ChronoField` instances will throw an `UnsupportedTemporalTypeException`.
If the field is not a `ChronoField`, then the result of this method
is obtained by invoking `TemporalField.getFrom(TemporalAccessor)`
passing `this` as the argument. Whether the value can be obtained,
and what the value represents, is determined by the field.
Specified by:

values based on this date.
All other `ChronoField` instances will throw an `UnsupportedTemporalTypeException`.
If the field is not a `ChronoField`, then the result of this method
is obtained by invoking `TemporalField.getFrom(TemporalAccessor)`
passing `this` as the argument. Whether the value can be obtained,
and what the value represents, is determined by the field.

+ ### getChronology
public IsoChronology getChronology()
Gets the chronology of this date, which is the ISO calendar system.
The `Chronology` represents the calendar system in use.
The ISO-8601 calendar system is the modern civil calendar system used today
in most of the world. It is equivalent to the proleptic Gregorian calendar
system, in which today's rules for leap years are applied for all time.
Specified by:
:   `getChronology` in interface `ChronoLocalDate`
Returns:
:   the ISO chronology, not null
+ ### getEra
public IsoEra getEra()
Gets the era applicable at this date.
The official ISO-8601 standard does not define eras, however `IsoChronology` does.
It defines two eras, 'CE' from year one onwards and 'BCE' from year zero backwards.
Since dates before the Julian-Gregorian cutover are not in line with history,
the cutover between 'BCE' and 'CE' is also not aligned with the commonly used
eras, often referred to using 'BC' and 'AD'.
Users of this class should typically ignore this method as it exists primarily
to fulfill the `ChronoLocalDate` contract where it is necessary to support
the Japanese calendar system.
Specified by:
:   `getEra` in interface `ChronoLocalDate`
Returns:
:   the IsoEra applicable at this date, not null
+ ### getYear
public int getYear()
Gets the year field.
This method returns the primitive `int` value for the year.
The year returned by this method is proleptic as per `get(YEAR)`.
To obtain the year-of-era, use `get(YEAR_OF_ERA)`.
Returns:
:   the year, from MIN\_YEAR to MAX\_YEAR
+ ### getMonthValue
public int getMonthValue()
Gets the month-of-year field from 1 to 12.
This method returns the month as an `int` from 1 to 12.
Application code is frequently clearer if the enum `Month`
is used by calling `getMonth()`).
Returns:
:   the month-of-year, from 1 to 12
+ ### getMonth
public Month getMonth()
Gets the month-of-year field using the `Month` enum.
This method returns the enum `Month` for the month.
This avoids confusion as to what `int` values mean.
If you need access to the primitive `int` value then the enum
provides the `int value`).
Returns:
:   the month-of-year, not null
+ ### getDayOfMonth
public int getDayOfMonth()
Gets the day-of-month field.
This method returns the primitive `int` value for the day-of-month.
Returns:
:   the day-of-month, from 1 to 31
+ ### getDayOfYear
public int getDayOfYear()
Gets the day-of-year field.
This method returns the primitive `int` value for the day-of-year.
Returns:
:   the day-of-year, from 1 to 365, or 366 in a leap year
+ ### getDayOfWeek
public DayOfWeek getDayOfWeek()
Gets the day-of-week field, which is an enum `DayOfWeek`.
This method returns the enum `DayOfWeek` for the day-of-week.
This avoids confusion as to what `int` values mean.
If you need access to the primitive `int` value then the enum
provides the `int value`).
Additional information can be obtained from the `DayOfWeek`.
This includes textual names of the values.
Returns:
:   the day-of-week, not null
+ ### isLeapYear
public boolean isLeapYear()
Checks if the year is a leap year, according to the ISO proleptic
calendar system rules.
This method applies the current rules for leap years across the whole time-line.
In general, a year is a leap year if it is divisible by four without
remainder. However, years divisible by 100, are not leap years, with
the exception of years divisible by 400 which are.
For example, 1904 is a leap year it is divisible by 4.
1900 was not a leap year as it is divisible by 100, however 2000 was a
leap year as it is divisible by 400.
The calculation is proleptic - applying the same rules into the far future and far past.
This is historically inaccurate, but is correct for the ISO-8601 standard.
Specified by:
:   `isLeapYear` in interface `ChronoLocalDate`
Returns:
:   true if the year is leap, false otherwise
+ ### lengthOfMonth
public int lengthOfMonth()
Returns the length of the month represented by this date.
This returns the length of the month in days.
For example, a date in January would return 31.
Specified by:
:   `lengthOfMonth` in interface `ChronoLocalDate`
Returns:
:   the length of the month in days
+ ### lengthOfYear
public int lengthOfYear()
Returns the length of the year represented by this date.
This returns the length of the year in days, either 365 or 366.
Specified by:
:   `lengthOfYear` in interface `ChronoLocalDate`
Returns:
:   366 if the year is leap, 365 otherwise
+ ### with
public LocalDate with(TemporalAdjuster adjuster)
Returns an adjusted copy of this date.
This returns a `LocalDate`, based on this one, with the date adjusted.
The adjustment takes place using the specified adjuster strategy object.
Read the documentation of the adjuster to understand what adjustment will be made.
A simple adjuster might simply set the one of the fields, such as the year field.
A more complex adjuster might set the date to the last day of the month.
A selection of common adjustments is provided in
`TemporalAdjusters`.
These include finding the "last day of the month" and "next Wednesday".
Key date-time classes also implement the `TemporalAdjuster` interface,
such as `Month` and `MonthDay`.
The adjuster is responsible for handling special cases, such as the varying
lengths of month and leap years.
For example this code returns a date on the last day of July:
```
import static java.time.Month.*;
import static java.time.temporal.TemporalAdjusters.*;
result = localDate.with(JULY).with(lastDayOfMonth());
```
The result of this method is obtained by invoking the
`TemporalAdjuster.adjustInto(Temporal)`) method on the
specified adjuster passing `this` as the argument.
This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.
Specified by:
:   `with` in interface `ChronoLocalDate`
Specified by:
:   `with` in interface `Temporal`
Parameters:

This returns a `LocalDate`, based on this one, with the value
for the specified field changed.
This can be used to change any supported field, such as the year, month or day-of-month.
If it is not possible to set the value, because the field is not supported or for
some other reason, an exception is thrown.
In some cases, changing the specified field can cause the resulting date to become invalid,
such as changing the month from 31st January to February would make the day-of-month invalid.
In cases like this, the field is responsible for resolving the date. Typically it will choose
the previous valid date, which would be the last valid day of February in this example.
If the field is a `ChronoField` then the adjustment is implemented here.
The supported fields behave as follows:
- `DAY_OF_WEEK` -
Returns a `LocalDate` with the specified day-of-week.
The date is adjusted up to 6 days forward or backward within the boundary
of a Monday to Sunday week.
- `ALIGNED_DAY_OF_WEEK_IN_MONTH` -
Returns a `LocalDate` with the specified aligned-day-of-week.
The date is adjusted to the specified month-based aligned-day-of-week.
Aligned weeks are counted such that the first week of a given month starts
on the first day of that month.
This may cause the date to be moved up to 6 days into the following month.
- `ALIGNED_DAY_OF_WEEK_IN_YEAR` -
Returns a `LocalDate` with the specified aligned-day-of-week.
The date is adjusted to the specified year-based aligned-day-of-week.
Aligned weeks are counted such that the first week of a given year starts
on the first day of that year.
This may cause the date to be moved up to 6 days into the following year.
- `DAY_OF_MONTH` -
Returns a `LocalDate` with the specified day-of-month.
The month and year will be unchanged. If the day-of-month is invalid for the
year and month, then a `DateTimeException` is thrown.
- `DAY_OF_YEAR` -
Returns a `LocalDate` with the specified day-of-year.
The year will be unchanged. If the day-of-year is invalid for the
year, then a `DateTimeException` is thrown.
- `EPOCH_DAY` -
Returns a `LocalDate` with the specified epoch-day.
This completely replaces the date and is equivalent to `ofEpochDay(long)`).
- `ALIGNED_WEEK_OF_MONTH` -
Returns a `LocalDate` with the specified aligned-week-of-month.
Aligned weeks are counted such that the first week of a given month starts
on the first day of that month.
This adjustment moves the date in whole week chunks to match the specified week.
The result will have the same day-of-week as this date.
This may cause the date to be moved into the following month.
- `ALIGNED_WEEK_OF_YEAR` -
Returns a `LocalDate` with the specified aligned-week-of-year.
Aligned weeks are counted such that the first week of a given year starts
on the first day of that year.
This adjustment moves the date in whole week chunks to match the specified week.
The result will have the same day-of-week as this date.
This may cause the date to be moved into the following year.
- `MONTH_OF_YEAR` -
Returns a `LocalDate` with the specified month-of-year.
The year will be unchanged. The day-of-month will also be unchanged,
unless it would be invalid for the new month and year. In that case, the
day-of-month is adjusted to the maximum valid value for the new month and year.
- `PROLEPTIC_MONTH` -
Returns a `LocalDate` with the specified proleptic-month.
The day-of-month will be unchanged, unless it would be invalid for the new month
and year. In that case, the day-of-month is adjusted to the maximum valid value
for the new month and year.
- `YEAR_OF_ERA` -
Returns a `LocalDate` with the specified year-of-era.
The era and month will be unchanged. The day-of-month will also be unchanged,
unless it would be invalid for the new month and year. In that case, the
day-of-month is adjusted to the maximum valid value for the new month and year.
- `YEAR` -
Returns a `LocalDate` with the specified year.
The month will be unchanged. The day-of-month will also be unchanged,
unless it would be invalid for the new month and year. In that case, the
day-of-month is adjusted to the maximum valid value for the new month and year.
- `ERA` -
Returns a `LocalDate` with the specified era.
The year-of-era and month will be unchanged. The day-of-month will also be unchanged,
unless it would be invalid for the new month and year. In that case, the
day-of-month is adjusted to the maximum valid value for the new month and year.
In all cases, if the new value is outside the valid range of values for the field
then a `DateTimeException` will be thrown.
All other `ChronoField` instances will throw an `UnsupportedTemporalTypeException`.
If the field is not a `ChronoField`, then the result of this method
is obtained by invoking `TemporalField.adjustInto(Temporal, long)`
passing `this` as the argument. In this case, the field determines
whether and how to adjust the instant.
This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.

+ ### plus
public LocalDate plus(TemporalAmount amountToAdd)
Returns a copy of this date with the specified amount added.
This returns a `LocalDate`, based on this one, with the specified amount added.
The amount is typically `Period` but may be any other type implementing
the `TemporalAmount` interface.
The calculation is delegated to the amount object by calling
`TemporalAmount.addTo(Temporal)`). The amount implementation is free
to implement the addition in any way it wishes, however it typically
calls back to `plus(long, TemporalUnit)`). Consult the documentation
of the amount implementation to determine if it can be successfully added.
This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.
Specified by:
:   `plus` in interface `ChronoLocalDate`
Specified by:
:   `plus` in interface `Temporal`
Parameters:
:   `amountToAdd` - the amount to add, not null
Returns:
:   a `LocalDate` based on this date with the addition made, not null
Throws:
:   `DateTimeException` - if the addition cannot be made

+ ### plus
public LocalDate plus(long amountToAdd,
TemporalUnit unit)
Returns a copy of this date with the specified amount added.
This returns a `LocalDate`, based on this one, with the amount
in terms of the unit added. If it is not possible to add the amount, because the
unit is not supported or for some other reason, an exception is thrown.
In some cases, adding the amount can cause the resulting date to become invalid.
For example, adding one month to 31st January would result in 31st February.
In cases like this, the unit is responsible for resolving the date.
Typically it will choose the previous valid date, which would be the last valid
day of February in this example.
If the field is a `ChronoUnit` then the addition is implemented here.
The supported fields behave as follows:
- `DAYS` -
Returns a `LocalDate` with the specified number of days added.
This is equivalent to `plusDays(long)`).
- `WEEKS` -
Returns a `LocalDate` with the specified number of weeks added.
This is equivalent to `plusWeeks(long)`) and uses a 7 day week.
- `MONTHS` -
Returns a `LocalDate` with the specified number of months added.
This is equivalent to `plusMonths(long)`).
The day-of-month will be unchanged unless it would be invalid for the new
month and year. In that case, the day-of-month is adjusted to the maximum
valid value for the new month and year.
- `YEARS` -
Returns a `LocalDate` with the specified number of years added.
This is equivalent to `plusYears(long)`).
The day-of-month will be unchanged unless it would be invalid for the new
month and year. In that case, the day-of-month is adjusted to the maximum
valid value for the new month and year.
- `DECADES` -
Returns a `LocalDate` with the specified number of decades added.
This is equivalent to calling `plusYears(long)`) with the amount
multiplied by 10.
The day-of-month will be unchanged unless it would be invalid for the new
month and year. In that case, the day-of-month is adjusted to the maximum
valid value for the new month and year.
- `CENTURIES` -
Returns a `LocalDate` with the specified number of centuries added.
This is equivalent to calling `plusYears(long)`) with the amount
multiplied by 100.
The day-of-month will be unchanged unless it would be invalid for the new
month and year. In that case, the day-of-month is adjusted to the maximum
valid value for the new month and year.
- `MILLENNIA` -
Returns a `LocalDate` with the specified number of millennia added.
This is equivalent to calling `plusYears(long)`) with the amount
multiplied by 1,000.
The day-of-month will be unchanged unless it would be invalid for the new
month and year. In that case, the day-of-month is adjusted to the maximum
valid value for the new month and year.
- `ERAS` -
Returns a `LocalDate` with the specified number of eras added.
Only two eras are supported so the amount must be one, zero or minus one.
If the amount is non-zero then the year is changed such that the year-of-era
is unchanged.
The day-of-month will be unchanged unless it would be invalid for the new
month and year. In that case, the day-of-month is adjusted to the maximum
valid value for the new month and year.
All other `ChronoUnit` instances will throw an `UnsupportedTemporalTypeException`.
If the field is not a `ChronoUnit`, then the result of this method
is obtained by invoking `TemporalUnit.addTo(Temporal, long)`
passing `this` as the argument. In this case, the unit determines
whether and how to perform the addition.
This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.
Specified by:
:   `plus` in interface `ChronoLocalDate`
Specified by:
:   `plus` in interface `Temporal`
Parameters:

:   `ArithmeticException` - if numeric overflow occurs
+ ### plusYears
public LocalDate plusYears(long yearsToAdd)
Returns a copy of this `LocalDate` with the specified number of years added.
This method adds the specified amount to the years field in three steps:
1. Add the input years to the year field
2. Check if the resulting date would be invalid
3. Adjust the day-of-month to the last valid day if necessary
For example, 2008-02-29 (leap year) plus one year would result in the
invalid date 2009-02-29 (standard year). Instead of returning an invalid
result, the last valid day of the month, 2009-02-28, is selected instead.
This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.
Parameters:
:   `yearsToAdd` - the years to add, may be negative
Returns:
:   a `LocalDate` based on this date with the years added, not null
Throws:

+ ### plusMonths
public LocalDate plusMonths(long monthsToAdd)
Returns a copy of this `LocalDate` with the specified number of months added.
This method adds the specified amount to the months field in three steps:
1. Add the input months to the month-of-year field
2. Check if the resulting date would be invalid
3. Adjust the day-of-month to the last valid day if necessary
For example, 2007-03-31 plus one month would result in the invalid date
2007-04-31. Instead of returning an invalid result, the last valid day
of the month, 2007-04-30, is selected instead.
This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.
Parameters:
:   `monthsToAdd` - the months to add, may be negative
Returns:

the month and year fields as necessary to ensure the result remains valid.
The result is only invalid if the maximum/minimum year is exceeded.
For example, 2008-12-31 plus one week would result in 2009-01-07.
This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.
Parameters:
:   `weeksToAdd` - the weeks to add, may be negative

This returns a `LocalDate`, based on this one, with the specified amount subtracted.
The amount is typically `Period` but may be any other type implementing
the `TemporalAmount` interface.
The calculation is delegated to the amount object by calling
`TemporalAmount.subtractFrom(Temporal)`). The amount implementation is free
to implement the subtraction in any way it wishes, however it typically
calls back to `minus(long, TemporalUnit)`). Consult the documentation
of the amount implementation to determine if it can be successfully subtracted.

+ ### query
public <R> R query(TemporalQuery<R> query)
Queries this date using the specified query.
This queries this date using the specified query strategy object.
The `TemporalQuery` object defines the logic to be used to
obtain the result. Read the documentation of the query to understand
what the result of this method will be.
The result of this method is obtained by invoking the
`TemporalQuery.queryFrom(TemporalAccessor)`) method on the
specified query passing `this` as the argument.
Specified by:
:   `query` in interface `ChronoLocalDate`
Specified by:
:   `query` in interface `TemporalAccessor`
Parameters:
:   `query` - the query to invoke, not null
Returns:
:   the query result, null may be returned (defined by the query)
Throws:
:   `DateTimeException` - if unable to query (defined by the query)
:   `ArithmeticException` - if numeric overflow occurs (defined by the query)
+ ### adjustInto
public Temporal adjustInto(Temporal temporal)
Adjusts the specified temporal object to have the same date as this object.
This returns a temporal object of the same observable type as the input
with the date changed to be the same as this.
The adjustment is equivalent to using `Temporal.with(TemporalField, long)`)
passing `ChronoField.EPOCH_DAY` as the field.
In most cases, it is clearer to reverse the calling pattern by using
`Temporal.with(TemporalAdjuster)`):
```
// these two lines are equivalent, but the second approach is recommended
temporal = thisLocalDate.adjustInto(temporal);
temporal = temporal.with(thisLocalDate);
```
This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.
Specified by:
:   `adjustInto` in interface `ChronoLocalDate`
Specified by:
:   `adjustInto` in interface `TemporalAdjuster`
Parameters:
:   `temporal` - the target object to be adjusted, not null
Returns:
:   the adjusted object, not null
Throws:
:   `DateTimeException` - if unable to make the adjustment
:   `ArithmeticException` - if numeric overflow occurs
+ ### until
public long until(Temporal endExclusive,
TemporalUnit unit)
Calculates the amount of time until another date in terms of the specified unit.
This calculates the amount of time between two `LocalDate`
objects in terms of a single `TemporalUnit`.
The start and end points are `this` and the specified date.
The result will be negative if the end is before the start.
The `Temporal` passed to this method is converted to a
`LocalDate` using `from(TemporalAccessor)`).
For example, the amount in days between two dates can be calculated
using `startDate.until(endDate, DAYS)`.
The calculation returns a whole number, representing the number of
complete units between the two dates.
For example, the amount in months between 2012-06-15 and 2012-08-14
will only be one month as it is one day short of two months.
There are two equivalent ways of using this method.
The first is to invoke this method.
The second is to use `TemporalUnit.between(Temporal, Temporal)`):
```
// these two lines are equivalent
amount = start.until(end, MONTHS);
amount = MONTHS.between(start, end);
```
The choice should be made based on which makes the code more readable.
The calculation is implemented in this method for `ChronoUnit`.
The units `DAYS`, `WEEKS`, `MONTHS`, `YEARS`,
`DECADES`, `CENTURIES`, `MILLENNIA` and `ERAS`
are supported. Other `ChronoUnit` values will throw an exception.
If the unit is not a `ChronoUnit`, then the result of this method
is obtained by invoking `TemporalUnit.between(Temporal, Temporal)`
passing `this` as the first argument and the converted input temporal
as the second argument.
This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.
Specified by:
:   `until` in interface `ChronoLocalDate`
Specified by:
:   `until` in interface `Temporal`
Parameters:
:   `endExclusive` - the end date, exclusive, which is converted to a `LocalDate`, not null
:   `unit` - the unit to measure the amount in, not null
Returns:
:   the amount of time between this date and the end date
Throws:
:   `DateTimeException` - if the amount cannot be calculated, or the end
temporal cannot be converted to a `LocalDate`
:   `UnsupportedTemporalTypeException` - if the unit is not supported
:   `ArithmeticException` - if numeric overflow occurs
+ ### until
public Period until(ChronoLocalDate endDateExclusive)
Calculates the period between this date and another date as a `Period`.
This calculates the period between two dates in terms of years, months and days.
The start and end points are `this` and the specified date.
The result will be negative if the end is before the start.
The negative sign will be the same in each of year, month and day.
The calculation is performed using the ISO calendar system.
If necessary, the input date will be converted to ISO.
The start date is included, but the end date is not.
The period is calculated by removing complete months, then calculating
the remaining number of days, adjusting to ensure that both have the same sign.
The number of months is then normalized into years and months based on a 12 month year.
A month is considered to be complete if the end day-of-month is greater
than or equal to the start day-of-month.
For example, from `2010-01-15` to `2011-03-18` is "1 year, 2 months and 3 days".
There are two equivalent ways of using this method.
The first is to invoke this method.
The second is to use `Period.between(LocalDate, LocalDate)`):
```
// these two lines are equivalent
period = start.until(end);
period = Period.between(start, end);
```
The choice should be made based on which makes the code more readable.
Specified by:
:   `until` in interface `ChronoLocalDate`
Parameters:
:   `endDateExclusive` - the end date, exclusive, which may be in any chronology, not null
Returns:
:   the period between this date and the end date, not null
+ ### datesUntil
public Stream<LocalDate> datesUntil(LocalDate endExclusive)
Returns a sequential ordered stream of dates. The returned stream starts from this date
(inclusive) and goes to `endExclusive` (exclusive) by an incremental step of 1 day.
This method is equivalent to `datesUntil(endExclusive, Period.ofDays(1))`.
Parameters:
:   `endExclusive` - the end date, exclusive, not null
Returns:
:   a sequential `Stream` for the range of `LocalDate` values
Throws:
:   `IllegalArgumentException` - if end date is before this date
+ ### datesUntil
public Stream<LocalDate> datesUntil(LocalDate endExclusive,
Period step)
Returns a sequential ordered stream of dates by given incremental step. The returned stream
starts from this date (inclusive) and goes to `endExclusive` (exclusive).
The n-th date which appears in the stream is equal to `this.plus(step.multipliedBy(n))`
(but the result of step multiplication never overflows). For example, if this date is
`2015-01-31`, the end date is `2015-05-01` and the step is 1 month, then the
stream contains `2015-01-31`, `2015-02-28`, `2015-03-31`, and
`2015-04-30`.
Parameters:
:   `endExclusive` - the end date, exclusive, not null
:   `step` - the non-zero, non-negative `Period` which represents the step.
Returns:
:   a sequential `Stream` for the range of `LocalDate` values
Throws:
:   `IllegalArgumentException` - if step is zero, or `step.getDays()` and
`step.toTotalMonths()` have opposite sign, or end date is before this date
and step is positive, or end date is after this date and step is negative
+ ### format
public String format(DateTimeFormatter formatter)
Formats this date using the specified formatter.
This date will be passed to the formatter to produce a string.
Specified by:
:   `format` in interface `ChronoLocalDate`
Parameters:
:   `formatter` - the formatter to use, not null
Returns:

+ ### atStartOfDay
public LocalDateTime atStartOfDay()
Combines this date with the time of midnight to create a `LocalDateTime`
at the start of this date.
This returns a `LocalDateTime` formed from this date at the time of
midnight, 00:00, at the start of this date.
Returns:
:   the local date-time of midnight at the start of this date, not null
+ ### atStartOfDay
public ZonedDateTime atStartOfDay(ZoneId zone)
Returns a zoned date-time from this date at the earliest valid time according
to the rules in the time-zone.
Time-zone rules, such as daylight savings, mean that not every local date-time
is valid for the specified zone, thus the local date-time may not be midnight.
In most cases, there is only one valid offset for a local date-time.
In the case of an overlap, there are two valid offsets, and the earlier one is used,
corresponding to the first occurrence of midnight on the date.
In the case of a gap, the zoned date-time will represent the instant just after the gap.
If the zone ID is a `ZoneOffset`, then the result always has a time of midnight.
To convert to a specific time in a given time-zone call `atTime(LocalTime)`)
followed by `LocalDateTime.atZone(ZoneId)`).
Parameters:
:   `zone` - the zone ID to use, not null
Returns:
:   the zoned date-time formed from this date and the earliest valid time for the zone, not null
+ ### toEpochSecond
public long toEpochSecond(LocalTime time,
ZoneOffset offset)
Converts this `LocalDate` to the number of seconds since the epoch
of 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z.
This combines this local date with the specified time and
offset to calculate the epoch-second value, which is the
number of elapsed seconds from 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z.
Instants on the time-line after the epoch are positive, earlier
are negative.
Parameters:
:   `time` - the local time, not null
:   `offset` - the zone offset, not null
Returns:
:   the number of seconds since the epoch of 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z, may be negative
+ ### compareTo
public int compareTo(ChronoLocalDate other)
Compares this date to another date.
The comparison is primarily based on the date, from earliest to latest.
It is "consistent with equals", as defined by `Comparable`.
If all the dates being compared are instances of `LocalDate`,
then the comparison will be entirely based on the date.
If some dates being compared are in different chronologies, then the
chronology is also considered, see `ChronoLocalDate.compareTo(java.time.chrono.ChronoLocalDate)`).
Specified by:
:   `compareTo` in interface `ChronoLocalDate`
Specified by:
:   `compareTo` in interface `Comparable<ChronoLocalDate>`
Parameters:
:   `other` - the other date to compare to, not null
Returns:
:   the comparator value, that is the comparison of this local date with
the `other` local date and this chronology with the `other` chronology,
in order, returning the first non-zero result, and otherwise returning zero
+ ### isAfter
public boolean isAfter(ChronoLocalDate other)
Checks if this date is after the specified date.
This checks to see if this date represents a point on the
local time-line after the other date.
```
LocalDate a = LocalDate.of(2012, 6, 30);
LocalDate b = LocalDate.of(2012, 7, 1);
a.isAfter(b) == false
a.isAfter(a) == false
b.isAfter(a) == true
```
This method only considers the position of the two dates on the local time-line.
It does not take into account the chronology, or calendar system.
This is different from the comparison in `compareTo(ChronoLocalDate)`),
but is the same approach as `ChronoLocalDate.timeLineOrder()`).
Specified by:
:   `isAfter` in interface `ChronoLocalDate`
Parameters:
:   `other` - the other date to compare to, not null
Returns:
:   true if this date is after the specified date
+ ### isBefore
public boolean isBefore(ChronoLocalDate other)
Checks if this date is before the specified date.
This checks to see if this date represents a point on the
local time-line before the other date.
```
LocalDate a = LocalDate.of(2012, 6, 30);
LocalDate b = LocalDate.of(2012, 7, 1);
a.isBefore(b) == true
a.isBefore(a) == false
b.isBefore(a) == false
```
This method only considers the position of the two dates on the local time-line.
It does not take into account the chronology, or calendar system.
This is different from the comparison in `compareTo(ChronoLocalDate)`),
but is the same approach as `ChronoLocalDate.timeLineOrder()`).
Specified by:
:   `isBefore` in interface `ChronoLocalDate`
Parameters:
:   `other` - the other date to compare to, not null
Returns:
:   true if this date is before the specified date
+ ### isEqual
public boolean isEqual(ChronoLocalDate other)
Checks if this date is equal to the specified date.
This checks to see if this date represents the same point on the
local time-line as the other date.
```
LocalDate a = LocalDate.of(2012, 6, 30);
LocalDate b = LocalDate.of(2012, 7, 1);
a.isEqual(b) == false
a.isEqual(a) == true
b.isEqual(a) == false
```
This method only considers the position of the two dates on the local time-line.
It does not take into account the chronology, or calendar system.
This is different from the comparison in `compareTo(ChronoLocalDate)`)
but is the same approach as `ChronoLocalDate.timeLineOrder()`).
Specified by:
:   `isEqual` in interface `ChronoLocalDate`
Parameters:
:   `other` - the other date to compare to, not null
Returns:
:   true if this date is equal to the specified date
+ ### equals
public boolean equals(Object obj)
Checks if this date is equal to another date.
Compares this `LocalDate` with another ensuring that the date is the same.
Only objects of type `LocalDate` are compared, other types return false.
To compare the dates of two `TemporalAccessor` instances, including dates
in two different chronologies, use `ChronoField.EPOCH_DAY` as a comparator.
Specified by:
:   `equals` in interface `ChronoLocalDate`
Overrides:
:   `equals` in class `Object`
Parameters:
:   `obj` - the object to check, null returns false
Returns:
:   true if this is equal to the other date

public int hashCode()
A hash code for this date.
Specified by:
:   `hashCode` in interface `ChronoLocalDate`
Overrides:
:   `hashCode` in class `Object`
Returns:
:   a suitable hash code
+ ### toString
public String toString()
Outputs this date as a `String`, such as `2007-12-03`.
The output will be in the ISO-8601 format `uuuu-MM-dd`.
Specified by:
:   `toString` in interface `ChronoLocalDate`
Overrides:
:   `toString` in class `Object`
Returns:
:   a string representation of this date, not null
