# Class Thread
public class Thread
extends Object
implements Runnable
A *thread* is a thread of execution in a program. The Java
virtual machine allows an application to have multiple threads of
execution running concurrently.
`Thread` defines constructors and a `Thread.Builder` to create threads.
Starting) a thread schedules it to execute its `run`)
method. The newly started thread executes concurrently with the thread that caused
it to start.
A thread *terminates* if either its `run` method completes normally,
or if its `run` method completes abruptly and the appropriate uncaught exception handler completes normally or
abruptly. With no code left to run, the thread has completed execution. The
`join`) method can be used to wait for a thread to terminate.
Threads have a unique identifier) and a name). The identifier is generated when a `Thread` is created
and cannot be changed. The thread name can be specified when creating a thread
or can be changed) at a later time.
Threads support `ThreadLocal` variables. These are variables that are
local to a thread, meaning a thread can have a copy of a variable that is set to
a value that is independent of the value set by other threads. `Thread` also
supports `InheritableThreadLocal` variables that are thread local variables
that are inherited at thread creation time from the parent `Thread`.
`Thread` supports a special inheritable thread local for the thread
context-class-loader).
## Platform threads
`Thread` supports the creation of *platform threads* that are
typically mapped 1:1 to kernel threads scheduled by the operating system.
Platform threads will usually have a large stack and other resources that are
maintained by the operating system. Platforms threads are suitable for executing
all types of tasks but may be a limited resource.
Platform threads get an automatically generated thread name by default.
Platform threads are designated *daemon* or *non-daemon* threads.
When the Java virtual machine starts up, there is usually one non-daemon
thread (the thread that typically calls the application's `main` method).
The shutdown sequence begins when all started
non-daemon threads have terminated. Unstarted non-daemon threads do not prevent
the shutdown sequence from beginning.
In addition to the daemon status, platform threads have a thread priority) and are members of a thread group.
## Virtual threads
`Thread` also supports the creation of *virtual threads*.
Virtual threads are typically *user-mode threads* scheduled by the Java
runtime rather than the operating system. Virtual threads will typically require
few resources and a single Java virtual machine may support millions of virtual
threads. Virtual threads are suitable for executing tasks that spend most of
the time blocked, often waiting for I/O operations to complete. Virtual threads
are not intended for long running CPU intensive operations.
Virtual threads typically employ a small set of platform threads used as
*carrier threads*. Locking and I/O operations are examples of operations
where a carrier thread may be re-scheduled from one virtual thread to another.
Code executing in a virtual thread is not aware of the underlying carrier thread.
The currentThread()) method, used to obtain a reference
to the *current thread*, will always return the `Thread` object
for the virtual thread.
Virtual threads do not have a thread name by default. The `getName`) method returns the empty string if a thread name is not set.
Virtual threads are daemon threads and so do not prevent the
shutdown sequence from beginning.
Virtual threads have a fixed thread priority)
that cannot be changed.
## Creating and starting threads
`Thread` defines public constructors for creating platform threads and
the `start`) method to schedule threads to execute. `Thread`
may be extended for customization and other advanced reasons although most
applications should have little need to do this.
`Thread` defines a `Thread.Builder` API for creating and starting both
platform and virtual threads. The following are examples that use the builder:
Copy!Copy snippet
```
Runnable runnable = ...
// Start a daemon thread to run a task
Thread thread = Thread.ofPlatform().daemon().start(runnable);
// Create an unstarted thread with name "duke", its start() method
// must be invoked to schedule it to execute.
Thread thread = Thread.ofPlatform().name("duke").unstarted(runnable);
// A ThreadFactory that creates daemon threads named "worker-0", "worker-1", ...
ThreadFactory factory = Thread.ofPlatform().daemon().name("worker-", 0).factory();
// Start a virtual thread to run a task
Thread thread = Thread.ofVirtual().start(runnable);
// A ThreadFactory that creates virtual threads
ThreadFactory factory = Thread.ofVirtual().factory();
```
## Inheritance when creating threads
A `Thread` inherits its initial values of inheritable-thread-local variables (including the context class loader) from
the parent thread values at the time that the child `Thread` is created.
The 5-param constructor) can be used to create a thread that does not inherit its initial
values from the constructing thread. When using a `Thread.Builder`, the
`inheritInheritableThreadLocals`)
method can be used to select if the initial values are inherited.
Platform threads inherit the daemon status, thread priority, and when not
provided (or not selected by a security manager), the thread group.
Creating a platform thread captures) the
caller context to limit the permissions of the new thread when it executes code that performs a privileged action). The captured
caller context is the new thread's "Inherited `AccessControlContext`". Creating
a virtual thread does not capture the caller context; virtual threads have no
permissions when executing code that performs a privileged action.
Unless otherwise specified, passing a `null` argument to a constructor
or method in this class will cause a `NullPointerException` to be thrown.

is started. If `null`, this thread's run method is invoked.
:   `name` - the name of the new thread
+ ### Thread
public Thread(ThreadGroup group,
Runnable task,
String name)
Initializes a new platform `Thread` so that it has `task`
as its run object, has the specified `name` as its name,
and belongs to the thread group referred to by `group`.
If there is a security manager, its
`checkAccess`)
method is invoked with the ThreadGroup as its argument.
In addition, its `checkPermission` method is invoked with
the `RuntimePermission("enableContextClassLoaderOverride")`
permission when invoked directly or indirectly by the constructor
of a subclass which overrides the `getContextClassLoader`
or `setContextClassLoader` methods.
The priority of the newly created thread is the smaller of
priority of the thread creating it and the maximum permitted
priority of the thread group. The method setPriority) may be used to change the priority to a new value.
The newly created thread is initially marked as being a daemon
thread if and only if the thread creating it is currently marked
as a daemon thread. The method setDaemon)
may be used to change whether or not a thread is a daemon.
For a non-null group, task, and name, invoking this constructor directly
is equivalent to:
```
Thread.ofPlatform().group(group).name(name).unstarted(task);
```
Parameters:
:   `group` - the thread group. If `null` and there is a security
manager, the group is determined by SecurityManager.getThreadGroup()).
If there is not a security manager or `SecurityManager.getThreadGroup()` returns `null`, the group
is set to the current thread's thread group.
:   `task` - the object whose `run` method is invoked when this thread
is started. If `null`, this thread's run method is invoked.
:   `name` - the name of the new thread
Throws:
:   `SecurityException` - if the current thread cannot create a thread in the specified
thread group or cannot override the context class loader methods.
+ ### Thread
public Thread(ThreadGroup group,
Runnable task,
String name,
long stackSize)
Initializes a new platform `Thread` so that it has `task`
as its run object, has the specified `name` as its name,
and belongs to the thread group referred to by `group`, and has
the specified *stack size*.
This constructor is identical to `Thread(ThreadGroup,Runnable,String)`) with the exception of the fact
that it allows the thread stack size to be specified. The stack size
is the approximate number of bytes of address space that the virtual
machine is to allocate for this thread's stack. **The effect of the
`stackSize` parameter, if any, is highly platform dependent.**
On some platforms, specifying a higher value for the
`stackSize` parameter may allow a thread to achieve greater
recursion depth before throwing a `StackOverflowError`.
Similarly, specifying a lower value may allow a greater number of
threads to exist concurrently without throwing an `OutOfMemoryError` (or other internal error). The details of
the relationship between the value of the `stackSize` parameter
and the maximum recursion depth and concurrency level are
platform-dependent. **On some platforms, the value of the
`stackSize` parameter may have no effect whatsoever.**
The virtual machine is free to treat the `stackSize`
parameter as a suggestion. If the specified value is unreasonably low
for the platform, the virtual machine may instead use some
platform-specific minimum value; if the specified value is unreasonably
high, the virtual machine may instead use some platform-specific
maximum. Likewise, the virtual machine is free to round the specified
value up or down as it sees fit (or to ignore it completely).
Specifying a value of zero for the `stackSize` parameter will
cause this constructor to behave exactly like the
`Thread(ThreadGroup, Runnable, String)` constructor.
*Due to the platform-dependent nature of the behavior of this
constructor, extreme care should be exercised in its use.
The thread stack size necessary to perform a given computation will
likely vary from one JRE implementation to another. In light of this
variation, careful tuning of the stack size parameter may be required,
and the tuning may need to be repeated for each JRE implementation on
which an application is to run.*
Implementation note: Java platform implementers are encouraged to
document their implementation's behavior with respect to the
`stackSize` parameter.
For a non-null group, task, and name, invoking this constructor directly
is equivalent to:
```
Thread.ofPlatform().group(group).name(name).stackSize(stackSize).unstarted(task);
```
Parameters:
:   `group` - the thread group. If `null` and there is a security
manager, the group is determined by SecurityManager.getThreadGroup()).
If there is not a security manager or `SecurityManager.getThreadGroup()` returns `null`, the group
is set to the current thread's thread group.
:   `task` - the object whose `run` method is invoked when this thread
is started. If `null`, this thread's run method is invoked.
:   `name` - the name of the new thread
:   `stackSize` - the desired stack size for the new thread, or zero to indicate
that this parameter is to be ignored.
Throws:
:   `SecurityException` - if the current thread cannot create a thread in the specified
thread group
+ ### Thread
public Thread(ThreadGroup group,
Runnable task,
String name,
long stackSize,
boolean inheritInheritableThreadLocals)
Initializes a new platform `Thread` so that it has `task`
as its run object, has the specified `name` as its name,
belongs to the thread group referred to by `group`, has
the specified `stackSize`, and inherits initial values for
inheritable thread-local variables
if `inheritThreadLocals` is `true`.
This constructor is identical to `Thread(ThreadGroup,Runnable,String,long)`) with the added ability to
suppress, or not, the inheriting of initial values for inheritable
thread-local variables from the constructing thread. This allows for
finer grain control over inheritable thread-locals. Care must be taken
when passing a value of `false` for `inheritThreadLocals`,
as it may lead to unexpected behavior if the new thread executes code
that expects a specific thread-local value to be inherited.
Specifying a value of `true` for the `inheritThreadLocals`
parameter will cause this constructor to behave exactly like the
`Thread(ThreadGroup, Runnable, String, long)` constructor.
For a non-null group, task, and name, invoking this constructor directly
is equivalent to:
```
Thread.ofPlatform()
.group(group)
.name(name)
.stackSize(stackSize)
.inheritInheritableThreadLocals(inheritInheritableThreadLocals)
.unstarted(task);
```
Parameters:
:   `group` - the thread group. If `null` and there is a security
manager, the group is determined by SecurityManager.getThreadGroup()).
If there is not a security manager or `SecurityManager.getThreadGroup()` returns `null`, the group
is set to the current thread's thread group.
:   `task` - the object whose `run` method is invoked when this thread
is started. If `null`, this thread's run method is invoked.
:   `name` - the name of the new thread
:   `stackSize` - the desired stack size for the new thread, or zero to indicate
that this parameter is to be ignored
:   `inheritInheritableThreadLocals` - if `true`, inherit initial values for inheritable
thread-locals from the constructing thread, otherwise no initial
values are inherited
Throws:
:   `SecurityException` - if the current thread cannot create a thread in the specified
thread group
+ ### currentThread
public static Thread currentThread()
Returns the Thread object for the current thread.
Returns:
:   the current thread
+ ### yield
public static void yield()
A hint to the scheduler that the current thread is willing to yield
its current use of a processor. The scheduler is free to ignore this
hint.
Yield is a heuristic attempt to improve relative progression
between threads that would otherwise over-utilise a CPU. Its use
should be combined with detailed profiling and benchmarking to
ensure that it actually has the desired effect.
It is rarely appropriate to use this method. It may be useful
for debugging or testing purposes, where it may help to reproduce
bugs due to race conditions. It may also be useful when designing
concurrency control constructs such as the ones in the
`java.util.concurrent.locks` package.
+ ### sleep
public static void sleep(long millis)
throws InterruptedException
Causes the currently executing thread to sleep (temporarily cease
execution) for the specified number of milliseconds, subject to
the precision and accuracy of system timers and schedulers. The thread
does not lose ownership of any monitors.
Parameters:
:   `millis` - the length of time to sleep in milliseconds
Throws:
:   `IllegalArgumentException` - if the value of `millis` is negative
:   `InterruptedException` - if any thread has interrupted the current thread. The
*interrupted status* of the current thread is
cleared when this exception is thrown.
+ ### sleep
public static void sleep(long millis,
int nanos)
throws InterruptedException
Causes the currently executing thread to sleep (temporarily cease
execution) for the specified number of milliseconds plus the specified
number of nanoseconds, subject to the precision and accuracy of system
timers and schedulers. The thread does not lose ownership of any
monitors.
Parameters:
:   `millis` - the length of time to sleep in milliseconds
:   `nanos` - `0-999999` additional nanoseconds to sleep
Throws:
:   `IllegalArgumentException` - if the value of `millis` is negative, or the value of
`nanos` is not in the range `0-999999`
:   `InterruptedException` - if any thread has interrupted the current thread. The
*interrupted status* of the current thread is
cleared when this exception is thrown.
+ ### sleep
public static void sleep(Duration duration)
throws InterruptedException
Causes the currently executing thread to sleep (temporarily cease
execution) for the specified duration, subject to the precision and
accuracy of system timers and schedulers. This method is a no-op if
the duration is negative).
Parameters:
:   `duration` - the duration to sleep
Throws:
:   `InterruptedException` - if the current thread is interrupted while sleeping. The
*interrupted status* of the current thread is
cleared when this exception is thrown.
+ ### onSpinWait
public static void onSpinWait()
Indicates that the caller is momentarily unable to progress, until the
occurrence of one or more actions on the part of other activities. By
invoking this method within each iteration of a spin-wait loop construct,
the calling thread indicates to the runtime that it is busy-waiting.
The runtime may take action to improve the performance of invoking
spin-wait loop constructions.
API Note:
:   As an example consider a method in a class that spins in a loop until
some flag is set outside of that method. A call to the `onSpinWait`
method should be placed inside the spin loop.
Copy!Copy snippet
```
class EventHandler {
volatile boolean eventNotificationNotReceived;
void waitForEventAndHandleIt() {
while ( eventNotificationNotReceived ) {
Thread.onSpinWait();
}
readAndProcessEvent();
}
void readAndProcessEvent() {
// Read event from some source and process it
. . .
}
}
```
The code above would remain correct even if the `onSpinWait`
method was not called at all. However on some architectures the Java
Virtual Machine may issue the processor instructions to address such
code patterns in a more beneficial way.
+ ### ofPlatform
public static Thread.Builder.OfPlatform ofPlatform()
Returns a builder for creating a platform `Thread` or `ThreadFactory`
that creates platform threads.
**Interaction with security manager when
creating platform threads**
Creating a platform thread when there is a security manager set will
invoke the security manager's `checkAccess(ThreadGroup)`) method with the thread's thread group.
If the thread group has not been set with the `OfPlatform.group`) method then the
security manager's `getThreadGroup`)
method will be invoked first to select the thread group. If the security
manager `getThreadGroup` method returns `null` then the thread
group of the constructing thread is used.
API Note:
:   The following are examples using the builder:
Copy!Copy snippet
```
// Start a daemon thread to run a task
Thread thread = Thread.ofPlatform().daemon().start(runnable);
// Create an unstarted thread with name "duke", its start() method
// must be invoked to schedule it to execute.
Thread thread = Thread.ofPlatform().name("duke").unstarted(runnable);
// A ThreadFactory that creates daemon threads named "worker-0", "worker-1", ...
ThreadFactory factory = Thread.ofPlatform().daemon().name("worker-", 0).factory();
```
Returns:
:   A builder for creating `Thread` or `ThreadFactory` objects.
+ ### ofVirtual
public static Thread.Builder.OfVirtual ofVirtual()
Returns a builder for creating a virtual `Thread` or `ThreadFactory`
that creates virtual threads.
API Note:
:   The following are examples using the builder:
Copy!Copy snippet
```
// Start a virtual thread to run a task.
Thread thread = Thread.ofVirtual().start(runnable);
// A ThreadFactory that creates virtual threads
ThreadFactory factory = Thread.ofVirtual().factory();
```
Returns:
:   A builder for creating `Thread` or `ThreadFactory` objects.
+ ### clone
protected Object clone()
throws CloneNotSupportedException
Throws CloneNotSupportedException as a Thread can not be meaningfully
cloned. Construct a new Thread instead.
Overrides:
:   `clone` in class `Object`
Returns:
:   a clone of this instance.
Throws:
:   `CloneNotSupportedException` - always
+ ### startVirtualThread
public static Thread startVirtualThread(Runnable task)
Creates a virtual thread to execute a task and schedules it to execute.
This method is equivalent to:
```
Thread.ofVirtual().start(task);
```
Parameters:
:   `task` - the object to run when the thread executes
Returns:
:   a new, and started, virtual thread
+ ### isVirtual
public final boolean isVirtual()
Returns `true` if this thread is a virtual thread. A virtual thread
is scheduled by the Java virtual machine rather than the operating system.
Returns:
:   `true` if this thread is a virtual thread
+ ### start
public void start()
Schedules this thread to begin execution. The thread will execute
independently of the current thread.
A thread can be started at most once. In particular, a thread can not
be restarted after it has terminated.
Throws:
:   `IllegalThreadStateException` - if the thread was already started
+ ### run
public void run()
This method is run by the thread when it executes. Subclasses of `Thread` may override this method.
This method is not intended to be invoked directly. If this thread is a
platform thread created with a `Runnable` task then invoking this method
will invoke the task's `run` method. If this thread is a virtual thread
then invoking this method directly does nothing.
Specified by:
:   `run` in interface `Runnable`
Implementation Requirements:
:   The default implementation executes the `Runnable` task that
the `Thread` was created with. If the thread was created without a task
then this method does nothing.
+ ### stop
@Deprecated(since)="1.2",
forRemoval)=true)
public final void stop()
Deprecated, for removal: This API element is subject to removal in a future version.
This method was originally specified to "stop" a victim
thread by causing the victim thread to throw a `ThreadDeath`.
It was inherently unsafe. Stopping a thread caused it to unlock
all of the monitors that it had locked (as a natural consequence
of the `ThreadDeath` exception propagating up the stack). If
any of the objects previously protected by these monitors were in
an inconsistent state, the damaged objects became visible to
other threads, potentially resulting in arbitrary behavior.
Usages of `stop` should be replaced by code that simply
modifies some variable to indicate that the target thread should
stop running. The target thread should check this variable
regularly, and return from its run method in an orderly fashion
if the variable indicates that it is to stop running. If the
target thread waits for long periods (on a condition variable,
for example), the `interrupt` method should be used to
interrupt the wait.
For more information, see
[Why
are Thread.stop, Thread.suspend and Thread.resume Deprecated?.
Throws `UnsupportedOperationException`.
Throws:
:   `UnsupportedOperationException` - always
+ ### interrupt
public void interrupt()
Interrupts this thread.
Unless the current thread is interrupting itself, which is
always permitted, the `checkAccess`) method
of this thread is invoked, which may cause a `SecurityException` to be thrown.
If this thread is blocked in an invocation of the `wait()`), `wait(long)`), or `wait(long, int)`) methods of the `Object`
class, or of the `join()`), `join(long)`), `join(long, int)`), `sleep(long)`), or `sleep(long, int)`)
methods of this class, then its interrupt status will be cleared and it
will receive an `InterruptedException`.
If this thread is blocked in an I/O operation upon an `InterruptibleChannel`
then the channel will be closed, the thread's interrupt
status will be set, and the thread will receive a `ClosedByInterruptException`.
If this thread is blocked in a `Selector`
then the thread's interrupt status will be set and it will return
immediately from the selection operation, possibly with a non-zero
value, just as if the selector's `wakeup`) method were invoked.
If none of the previous conditions hold then this thread's interrupt
status will be set.
Interrupting a thread that is not alive need not have any effect.
that is not alive still records that the interrupt request was made and
will report it via `interrupted()`) and `isInterrupted()`).
Throws:
:   `SecurityException` - if the current thread cannot modify this thread
+ ### interrupted
public static boolean interrupted()
Tests whether the current thread has been interrupted. The
*interrupted status* of the thread is cleared by this method. In
other words, if this method were to be called twice in succession, the
second call would return false (unless the current thread were
interrupted again, after the first call had cleared its interrupted
status and before the second call had examined it).
Returns:
:   `true` if the current thread has been interrupted;
`false` otherwise.
+ ### isInterrupted
public boolean isInterrupted()
Tests whether this thread has been interrupted. The *interrupted
status* of the thread is unaffected by this method.
Returns:
:   `true` if this thread has been interrupted;
`false` otherwise.
+ ### isAlive
public final boolean isAlive()
Tests if this thread is alive. A thread is alive if it has
been started and has not yet terminated.
Returns:
:   `true` if this thread is alive;
`false` otherwise.
+ ### suspend
@Deprecated(since)="1.2",
forRemoval)=true)
public final void suspend()
Deprecated, for removal: This API element is subject to removal in a future version.
This method was originally specified to suspend a thread.
It was inherently deadlock-prone. If the target thread held a lock on
a monitor protecting a critical system resource when it was suspended,
no thread could access the resource until the target thread was resumed.
If the thread intending to resume the target thread attempted to lock
the monitor prior to calling `resume`, deadlock would result.
Such deadlocks typically manifested themselves as "frozen" processes.
For more information, see
[Why
are Thread.stop, Thread.suspend and Thread.resume Deprecated?.
Throws `UnsupportedOperationException`.
Throws:
:   `UnsupportedOperationException` - always
+ ### resume
@Deprecated(since)="1.2",
forRemoval)=true)
public final void resume()
Deprecated, for removal: This API element is subject to removal in a future version.
This method was originally specified to resume a thread
suspended with `suspend()`). Suspending a thread was
inherently deadlock-prone.
For more information, see
[Why
are Thread.stop, Thread.suspend and Thread.resume Deprecated?.
Throws `UnsupportedOperationException`.
Throws:
:   `UnsupportedOperationException` - always
+ ### setPriority
public final void setPriority(int newPriority)
Changes the priority of this thread.
For platform threads, the priority is set to the smaller of the specified
`newPriority` and the maximum permitted priority of the thread's
thread group.
The priority of a virtual thread is always `NORM_PRIORITY`
and `newPriority` is ignored.
Parameters:
:   `newPriority` - the new thread priority
Throws:
:   `IllegalArgumentException` - if the priority is not in the
range `MIN_PRIORITY` to `MAX_PRIORITY`.
:   `SecurityException` - if `checkAccess()`) determines that the current
thread cannot modify this thread
+ ### getPriority
public final int getPriority()
Returns this thread's priority.
The priority of a virtual thread is always `NORM_PRIORITY`.
Returns:
:   this thread's priority.
+ ### setName
public final void setName(String name)
Changes the name of this thread to be equal to the argument `name`.
First the `checkAccess` method of this thread is called
with no arguments. This may result in throwing a
`SecurityException`.
current thread, and it's a platform thread that was not attached to the
VM with the Java Native Interface
AttachCurrentThread function, then this method will set the operating
system thread name. This may be useful for debugging and troubleshooting
purposes.
Parameters:
:   `name` - the new name for this thread.
Throws:
:   `SecurityException` - if the current thread cannot modify this
thread.
External Specifications
:   - Java Native Interface Specification
+ ### getName
public final String getName()
Returns this thread's name.
Returns:
:   this thread's name.
+ ### getThreadGroup
public final ThreadGroup getThreadGroup()
Returns the thread's thread group or `null` if the thread has
terminated.
The thread group returned for a virtual thread is the special
[*ThreadGroup for
virtual threads*](ThreadGroup.html#virtualthreadgroup).
Returns:
:   this thread's thread group or `null`
+ ### activeCount
public static int activeCount()
Returns an estimate of the number of live)
platform threads in the current thread's thread group and its subgroups.
Virtual threads are not included in the estimate.
The value returned is only an estimate because the number of
threads may change dynamically while this method traverses internal
data structures, and might be affected by the presence of certain
system threads. This method is intended primarily for debugging
and monitoring purposes.
Returns:
:   an estimate of the number of live platform threads in the
current thread's thread group and in any other thread group
that has the current thread's thread group as an ancestor
+ ### enumerate
public static int enumerate(Thread[] tarray)
Copies into the specified array every live)
platform thread in the current thread's thread group and its subgroups.
This method simply invokes the [`ThreadGroup.enumerate(Thread[])`](ThreadGroup.html#enumerate(java.lang.Thread%5B%5D))
method of the current thread's thread group. Virtual threads are
not enumerated by this method.
An application might use the activeCount)
method to get an estimate of how big the array should be, however
*if the array is too short to hold all the threads, the extra threads
are silently ignored.* If it is critical to obtain every live
thread in the current thread's thread group and its subgroups, the
invoker should verify that the returned int value is strictly less
than the length of `tarray`.
Due to the inherent race condition in this method, it is recommended
that the method only be used for debugging and monitoring purposes.
Parameters:
:   `tarray` - an array into which to put the list of threads
Returns:
:   the number of threads put into the array
Throws:
:   `SecurityException` - if `ThreadGroup.checkAccess()`) determines that
the current thread cannot access its thread group
+ ### countStackFrames
@Deprecated(since)="1.2",
forRemoval)=true)
public int countStackFrames()
Deprecated, for removal: This API element is subject to removal in a future version.
This method was originally designed to count the number of
stack frames but the results were never well-defined and it
depended on thread-suspension.
This method is subject to removal in a future version of Java SE.
Throws `UnsupportedOperationException`.
Returns:
:   nothing
+ ### join
public final void join(long millis)
throws InterruptedException
Waits at most `millis` milliseconds for this thread to terminate.
A timeout of `0` means to wait forever.
This method returns immediately, without waiting, if the thread has not
been `started`).
calls conditioned on `this.isAlive`. As a thread terminates the
`this.notifyAll` method is invoked. It is recommended that
applications not use `wait`, `notify`, or
`notifyAll` on `Thread` instances.
Parameters:
:   `millis` - the time to wait in milliseconds
Throws:
:   `IllegalArgumentException` - if the value of `millis` is negative
:   `InterruptedException` - if any thread has interrupted the current thread. The
*interrupted status* of the current thread is
cleared when this exception is thrown.
+ ### join
public final void join(long millis,
int nanos)
throws InterruptedException
Waits at most `millis` milliseconds plus
`nanos` nanoseconds for this thread to terminate.
If both arguments are `0`, it means to wait forever.
This method returns immediately, without waiting, if the thread has not
been `started`).
calls conditioned on `this.isAlive`. As a thread terminates the
`this.notifyAll` method is invoked. It is recommended that
applications not use `wait`, `notify`, or
`notifyAll` on `Thread` instances.
Parameters:
:   `millis` - the time to wait in milliseconds
:   `nanos` - `0-999999` additional nanoseconds to wait
Throws:
:   `IllegalArgumentException` - if the value of `millis` is negative, or the value
of `nanos` is not in the range `0-999999`
:   `InterruptedException` - if any thread has interrupted the current thread. The
*interrupted status* of the current thread is
cleared when this exception is thrown.
+ ### join
public final void join()
throws InterruptedException
Waits for this thread to terminate.
An invocation of this method behaves in exactly the same
way as the invocation
join)`(0)`
Throws:
:   `InterruptedException` - if any thread has interrupted the current thread. The
*interrupted status* of the current thread is
cleared when this exception is thrown.
+ ### join
public final boolean join(Duration duration)
throws InterruptedException
Waits for this thread to terminate for up to the given waiting duration.
This method does not wait if the duration to wait is less than or
equal to zero. In this case, the method just tests if the thread has
terminated.
Parameters:
:   `duration` - the maximum duration to wait
Returns:
:   `true` if the thread has terminated, `false` if the
thread has not terminated
Throws:
:   `InterruptedException` - if the current thread is interrupted while waiting.
The *interrupted status* of the current thread is cleared
when this exception is thrown.
:   `IllegalThreadStateException` - if this thread has not been started.
+ ### dumpStack
public static void dumpStack()
Prints a stack trace of the current thread to the standard error stream.
This method is useful for debugging.
+ ### setDaemon
public final void setDaemon(boolean on)
Marks this thread as either a *daemon* or *non-daemon* thread.
The shutdown sequence begins when all
started non-daemon threads have terminated.
The daemon status of a virtual thread is always `true` and cannot be
changed by this method to `false`.
This method must be invoked before the thread is started. The behavior
of this method when the thread has terminated is not specified.
Parameters:
:   `on` - if `true`, marks this thread as a daemon thread
Throws:
:   `IllegalArgumentException` - if this is a virtual thread and `on` is false
:   `IllegalThreadStateException` - if this thread is alive)
:   `SecurityException` - if `checkAccess()`) determines that the current
thread cannot modify this thread
+ ### isDaemon
public final boolean isDaemon()
Tests if this thread is a daemon thread.
The daemon status of a virtual thread is always `true`.
Returns:
:   `true` if this thread is a daemon thread;
`false` otherwise.
+ ### checkAccess
@Deprecated(since)="17",
forRemoval)=true)
public final void checkAccess()
Deprecated, for removal: This API element is subject to removal in a future version.
This method is only useful in conjunction with
the Security Manager, which is
deprecated and subject to removal in a future release.
Consequently, this method is also deprecated and subject to
removal. There is no replacement for the Security Manager or this
method.
Determines if the currently running thread has permission to
modify this thread.
If there is a security manager, its `checkAccess` method
is called with this thread as its argument. This may result in
throwing a `SecurityException`.
Throws:
:   `SecurityException` - if the current thread is not allowed to
access this thread.
+ ### toString
public String toString()
Returns a string representation of this thread. The string representation
will usually include the thread's identifier) and
name. The default implementation for platform threads includes the thread's
identifier, name, priority, and the name of the thread group.
Overrides:
:   `toString` in class `Object`
Returns:
:   a string representation of this thread.
+ ### getContextClassLoader
public ClassLoader getContextClassLoader()
Returns the context `ClassLoader` for this thread.
The context `ClassLoader` may be set by the creator of the thread
for use by code running in this thread when loading classes and resources.
If not set), the default is to inherit
the context class loader from the parent thread.
The context `ClassLoader` of the primordial thread is typically
set to the class loader used to load the application.
Returns:
:   the context `ClassLoader` for this thread, or `null`
indicating the system class loader (or, failing that, the
bootstrap class loader)
Throws:
:   `SecurityException` - if a security manager is present, and the caller's class loader
is not `null` and is not the same as or an ancestor of the
context class loader, and the caller does not have the
`RuntimePermission``("getClassLoader")`
+ ### setContextClassLoader
public void setContextClassLoader(ClassLoader cl)
Sets the context `ClassLoader` for this thread.
The context `ClassLoader` may be set by the creator of the thread
for use by code running in this thread when loading classes and resources.
If a security manager is present, its `checkPermission`)
method is invoked with a `RuntimePermission``("setContextClassLoader")` permission to see if setting the context
ClassLoader is permitted.
Parameters:
:   `cl` - the context ClassLoader for this Thread, or null indicating the
system class loader (or, failing that, the bootstrap class loader)
Throws:
:   `SecurityException` - if the current thread cannot set the context ClassLoader
+ ### holdsLock
public static boolean holdsLock(Object obj)
Returns `true` if and only if the current thread holds the
monitor lock on the specified object.
This method is designed to allow a program to assert that
the current thread already holds a specified lock:
```
assert Thread.holdsLock(obj);
```
Parameters:
:   `obj` - the object on which to test lock ownership
Returns:
:   `true` if the current thread holds the monitor lock on
the specified object.
+ ### getStackTrace
public StackTraceElement[] getStackTrace()
Returns an array of stack trace elements representing the stack dump
of this thread. This method will return a zero-length array if
this thread has not started, has started but has not yet been
scheduled to run by the system, or has terminated.
If the returned array is of non-zero length then the first element of
the array represents the top of the stack, which is the most recent
method invocation in the sequence. The last element of the array
represents the bottom of the stack, which is the least recent method
invocation in the sequence.
If there is a security manager, and this thread is not
the current thread, then the security manager's
`checkPermission` method is called with a
`RuntimePermission("getStackTrace")` permission
to see if it's ok to get the stack trace.
Some virtual machines may, under some circumstances, omit one
or more stack frames from the stack trace. In the extreme case,
a virtual machine that has no stack trace information concerning
this thread is permitted to return a zero-length array from this
method.
Returns:
:   an array of `StackTraceElement`,
each represents one stack frame.
Throws:
:   `SecurityException` - if a security manager exists and its
`checkPermission` method doesn't allow
getting the stack trace of thread.
+ ### getAllStackTraces
public static Map<Thread,StackTraceElement[]> getAllStackTraces()
Returns a map of stack traces for all live platform threads. The map
does not include virtual threads.
The map keys are threads and each map value is an array of
`StackTraceElement` that represents the stack dump
of the corresponding `Thread`.
The returned stack traces are in the format specified for
the `getStackTrace`) method.
The threads may be executing while this method is called.
The stack trace of each thread only represents a snapshot and
each stack trace may be obtained at different time. A zero-length
array will be returned in the map value if the virtual machine has
no stack trace information about a thread.
If there is a security manager, then the security manager's
`checkPermission` method is called with a
`RuntimePermission("getStackTrace")` permission as well as
`RuntimePermission("modifyThreadGroup")` permission
to see if it is ok to get the stack trace of all threads.
Returns:
:   a `Map` from `Thread` to an array of
`StackTraceElement` that represents the stack trace of
the corresponding thread.
Throws:
:   `SecurityException` - if a security manager exists and its
`checkPermission` method doesn't allow
getting the stack trace of thread.
+ ### getId
@Deprecated(since)="19")
public long getId()
Deprecated.
This method is not final and may be overridden to return a
value that is not the thread ID. Use `threadId()`) instead.
Returns the identifier of this Thread. The thread ID is a positive
`long` number generated when this thread was created.
The thread ID is unique and remains unchanged during its lifetime.
Returns:
:   this thread's ID
+ ### threadId
public final long threadId()
Returns the identifier of this Thread. The thread ID is a positive
`long` number generated when this thread was created.
The thread ID is unique and remains unchanged during its lifetime.
Returns:
:   this thread's ID
+ ### getState
public Thread.State getState()
Returns the state of this thread.
This method is designed for use in monitoring of the system state,
not for synchronization control.
Returns:
:   this thread's state.
+ ### setDefaultUncaughtExceptionHandler
public static void setDefaultUncaughtExceptionHandler(Thread.UncaughtExceptionHandler ueh)
Set the default handler invoked when a thread abruptly terminates
due to an uncaught exception, and no other handler has been defined
for that thread.
Uncaught exception handling is controlled first by the thread, then
by the thread's `ThreadGroup` object and finally by the default
uncaught exception handler. If the thread does not have an explicit
uncaught exception handler set, and the thread's thread group
(including parent thread groups) does not specialize its
`uncaughtException` method, then the default handler's
`uncaughtException` method will be invoked.
By setting the default uncaught exception handler, an application
can change the way in which uncaught exceptions are handled (such as
logging to a specific device, or file) for those threads that would
already accept whatever "default" behavior the system
provided.
Note that the default uncaught exception handler should not usually
defer to the thread's `ThreadGroup` object, as that could cause
infinite recursion.
Parameters:
:   `ueh` - the object to use as the default uncaught exception handler.
If `null` then there is no default handler.
Throws:
:   `SecurityException` - if a security manager is present and it denies
`RuntimePermission``("setDefaultUncaughtExceptionHandler")`
+ ### getDefaultUncaughtExceptionHandler
public static Thread.UncaughtExceptionHandler getDefaultUncaughtExceptionHandler()
Returns the default handler invoked when a thread abruptly terminates
due to an uncaught exception. If the returned value is `null`,
there is no default.
Returns:
:   the default uncaught exception handler for all threads
+ ### getUncaughtExceptionHandler
public Thread.UncaughtExceptionHandler getUncaughtExceptionHandler()
Returns the handler invoked when this thread abruptly terminates
due to an uncaught exception. If this thread has not had an
uncaught exception handler explicitly set then this thread's
`ThreadGroup` object is returned, unless this thread
has terminated, in which case `null` is returned.
Returns:
:   the uncaught exception handler for this thread
+ ### setUncaughtExceptionHandler
public void setUncaughtExceptionHandler(Thread.UncaughtExceptionHandler ueh)
Set the handler invoked when this thread abruptly terminates
due to an uncaught exception.
A thread can take full control of how it responds to uncaught
exceptions by having its uncaught exception handler explicitly set.
If no such handler is set then the thread's `ThreadGroup`
object acts as its handler.
Parameters:
:   `ueh` - the object to use as this thread's uncaught exception
handler. If `null` then this thread has no explicit handler.
Throws:
:   `SecurityException` - if the current thread is not allowed to
modify this thread.
