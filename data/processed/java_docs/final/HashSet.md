# Class HashSet<E>
public class HashSet<E>
extends AbstractSet<E>
implements Set<E>, Cloneable, Serializable
This class implements the `Set` interface, backed by a hash table
(actually a `HashMap` instance). It makes no guarantees as to the
iteration order of the set; in particular, it does not guarantee that the
order will remain constant over time. This class permits the `null`
element.
This class offers constant time performance for the basic operations
(`add`, `remove`, `contains` and `size`),
assuming the hash function disperses the elements properly among the
buckets. Iterating over this set requires time proportional to the sum of
the `HashSet` instance's size (the number of elements) plus the
"capacity" of the backing `HashMap` instance (the number of
buckets). Thus, it's very important not to set the initial capacity too
high (or the load factor too low) if iteration performance is important.
**Note that this implementation is not synchronized.**
If multiple threads access a hash set concurrently, and at least one of
the threads modifies the set, it *must* be synchronized externally.
This is typically accomplished by synchronizing on some object that
naturally encapsulates the set.
If no such object exists, the set should be "wrapped" using the
`Collections.synchronizedSet`)
method. This is best done at creation time, to prevent accidental
unsynchronized access to the set:
```
Set s = Collections.synchronizedSet(new HashSet(...));
```
The iterators returned by this class's `iterator` method are
*fail-fast*: if the set is modified at any time after the iterator is
created, in any way except through the iterator's own `remove`
method, the Iterator throws a `ConcurrentModificationException`.
Thus, in the face of concurrent modification, the iterator fails quickly
and cleanly, rather than risking arbitrary, non-deterministic behavior at
an undetermined time in the future.
Note that the fail-fast behavior of an iterator cannot be guaranteed
as it is, generally speaking, impossible to make any hard guarantees in the
presence of unsynchronized concurrent modification. Fail-fast iterators
throw `ConcurrentModificationException` on a best-effort basis.
Therefore, it would be wrong to write a program that depended on this
exception for its correctness: *the fail-fast behavior of iterators
should be used only to detect bugs.*
This class is a member of the
Java Collections Framework.

unchanged and returns `false`.

element
+ ### remove
public boolean remove(Object o)
Removes the specified element from this set if it is present.
More formally, removes an element `e` such that
`Objects.equals(o, e)`,
if this set contains such an element. Returns `true` if
this set contained the element (or equivalently, if this set
changed as a result of the call). (This set will not contain the
element once the call returns.)

Returns:
:   a shallow copy of this set
+ ### spliterator
public Spliterator<E> spliterator()
Creates a *late-binding*
and *fail-fast* `Spliterator` over the elements in this
set.
The `Spliterator` reports `Spliterator.SIZED` and
`Spliterator.DISTINCT`. Overriding implementations should document
the reporting of additional characteristic values.
Specified by:

Specified by:
:   `spliterator` in interface `Iterable<E>`
Specified by:
:   `spliterator` in interface `Set<E>`
Returns:
:   a `Spliterator` over the elements in this set
+ ### toArray
public Object[] toArray()
Description copied from class: `AbstractCollection`
Returns an array containing all of the elements in this collection.
If this collection makes any guarantees as to what order its elements
are returned by its iterator, this method must return the elements in
the same order. The returned array's runtime component type) is `Object`.
The returned array will be "safe" in that no references to it are
maintained by this collection. (In other words, this method must
allocate a new array even if this collection is backed by an array).
The caller is thus free to modify the returned array.
Specified by:
:   `toArray` in interface `Collection<E>`
Specified by:
:   `toArray` in interface `Set<E>`
Overrides:
:   `toArray` in class `AbstractCollection<E>`
Returns:
:   an array, whose [runtime component
type) is `Object`, containing all of the elements in this collection
+ ### toArray
public <T> T[] toArray(T[] a)
Description copied from class: `AbstractCollection`
Returns an array containing all of the elements in this collection;
the runtime type of the returned array is that of the specified array.
If the collection fits in the specified array, it is returned therein.
Otherwise, a new array is allocated with the runtime type of the
specified array and the size of this collection.
If this collection fits in the specified array with room to spare
(i.e., the array has more elements than this collection), the element
in the array immediately following the end of the collection is set to
`null`. (This is useful in determining the length of this
collection *only* if the caller knows that this collection does
not contain any `null` elements.)
If this collection makes any guarantees as to what order its elements
are returned by its iterator, this method must return the elements in
the same order.
Specified by:
:   `toArray` in interface `Collection<E>`
Specified by:
:   `toArray` in interface `Set<E>`
Overrides:
:   `toArray` in class `AbstractCollection<E>`
Parameters:
:   `a` - the array into which the elements of this collection are to be
stored, if it is big enough; otherwise, a new array of the same
runtime type is allocated for this purpose.
Returns:
:   an array containing all of the elements in this collection
+ ### newHashSet
public static <T> HashSet<T> newHashSet(int numElements)
Creates a new, empty HashSet suitable for the expected number of elements.
The returned set uses the default load factor of 0.75, and its initial capacity is
generally large enough so that the expected number of elements can be added
without resizing the set.
Parameters:
:   `numElements` - the expected number of elements
Returns:
:   the newly created set
Throws:
:   `IllegalArgumentException` - if numElements is negative
