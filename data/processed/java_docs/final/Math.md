# Class Math
public final class Math
extends Object
The class `Math` contains methods for performing basic
numeric operations such as the elementary exponential, logarithm,
square root, and trigonometric functions.
Unlike some of the numeric methods of class
`StrictMath`, all implementations of the equivalent
functions of class `Math` are not defined to return the
bit-for-bit same results. This relaxation permits
better-performing implementations where strict reproducibility is
not required.
By default many of the `Math` methods simply call
the equivalent method in `StrictMath` for their
implementation. Code generators are encouraged to use
platform-specific native libraries or microprocessor instructions,
where available, to provide higher-performance implementations of
`Math` methods. Such higher-performance
implementations still must conform to the specification for
`Math`.
The quality of implementation specifications concern two
properties, accuracy of the returned result and monotonicity of the
method. Accuracy of the floating-point `Math` methods is
measured in terms of *ulps*, units in the last place. For a
given floating-point format, an ulp) of a
specific real number value is the distance between the two
floating-point values bracketing that numerical value. When
discussing the accuracy of a method as a whole rather than at a
specific argument, the number of ulps cited is for the worst-case
error at any argument. If a method always has an error less than
0.5 ulps, the method always returns the floating-point number
nearest the exact result; such a method is *correctly
rounded*. A correctly rounded method is generally the best a
floating-point approximation can be; however, it is impractical for
many floating-point methods to be correctly rounded. Instead, for
the `Math` class, a larger error bound of 1 or 2 ulps is
allowed for certain methods. Informally, with a 1 ulp error bound,
when the exact result is a representable number, the exact result
should be returned as the computed result; otherwise, either of the
two floating-point values which bracket the exact result may be
returned. For exact results large in magnitude, one of the
endpoints of the bracket may be infinite. Besides accuracy at
individual arguments, maintaining proper relations between the
method at different arguments is also important. Therefore, most
methods with more than 0.5 ulp errors are required to be
*semi-monotonic*: whenever the mathematical function is
non-decreasing, so is the floating-point approximation, likewise,
whenever the mathematical function is non-increasing, so is the
floating-point approximation. Not all approximations that have 1
ulp accuracy will automatically meet the monotonicity requirements.
The platform uses signed two's complement integer arithmetic with
int and long primitive types. The developer should choose
the primitive type to ensure that arithmetic operations consistently
produce correct results, which in some cases means the operations
will not overflow the range of values of the computation.
The best practice is to choose the primitive type and algorithm to avoid
overflow. In cases where the size is `int` or `long` and
overflow errors need to be detected, the methods whose names end with
`Exact` throw an `ArithmeticException` when the results overflow.
## IEEE 754 Recommended Operations
The 2019 revision of the IEEE 754 floating-point standard includes
a section of recommended operations and the semantics of those
operations if they are included in a programming environment. The
recommended operations present in this class include `sin`), `cos`), `tan`), `asin`), `acos`), `atan`), `exp`), `expm1`), `log`), `log10`), `log1p`),
`sinh`), `cosh`), `tanh`), `hypot`), and `pow`). (The `sqrt`)
operation is a required part of IEEE 754 from a different section
of the standard.) The special case behavior of the recommended
operations generally follows the guidance of the IEEE 754
standard. However, the `pow` method defines different
behavior for some arguments, as noted in its specification). The IEEE 754 standard defines its operations to be
correctly rounded, which is a more stringent quality of
implementation condition than required for most of the methods in
question that are also included in this class.

to the argument and is equal to a mathematical integer. If two
`double` values that are mathematical integers are
equally close, the result is the integer value that is
even. Special cases:
- If the argument value is already equal to a mathematical
integer, then the result is the same as the argument.
- If the argument is NaN or an infinity or positive zero or negative
zero, then the result is the same as the argument.
API Note:
:   This method corresponds to the roundToIntegralTiesToEven
operation defined in IEEE 754.
Parameters:
:   `a` - a `double` value.
Returns:
:   the closest floating-point value to `a` that is
equal to a mathematical integer.
+ ### atan2
public static double atan2(double y,
double x)
Returns the angle *theta* from the conversion of rectangular
coordinates (`x`, `y`) to polar
coordinates (r, *theta*).
This method computes the phase *theta* by computing an arc tangent
of `y/x` in the range of -*pi* to *pi*. Special
cases:
- If either argument is NaN, then the result is NaN.
- If the first argument is positive zero and the second argument
is positive, or the first argument is positive and finite and the
second argument is positive infinity, then the result is positive
zero.
- If the first argument is negative zero and the second argument
is positive, or the first argument is negative and finite and the
second argument is positive infinity, then the result is negative zero.
- If the first argument is positive zero and the second argument
is negative, or the first argument is positive and finite and the
second argument is negative infinity, then the result is the
`double` value closest to *pi*.
- If the first argument is negative zero and the second argument
is negative, or the first argument is negative and finite and the
second argument is negative infinity, then the result is the
`double` value closest to -*pi*.
- If the first argument is positive and the second argument is
positive zero or negative zero, or the first argument is positive
infinity and the second argument is finite, then the result is the
`double` value closest to *pi*/2.
- If the first argument is negative and the second argument is
positive zero or negative zero, or the first argument is negative
infinity and the second argument is finite, then the result is the
`double` value closest to -*pi*/2.
- If both arguments are positive infinity, then the result is the
`double` value closest to *pi*/4.
- If the first argument is positive infinity and the second argument
is negative infinity, then the result is the `double`
value closest to 3\**pi*/4.
- If the first argument is negative infinity and the second argument
is positive infinity, then the result is the `double` value
closest to -*pi*/4.
- If both arguments are negative infinity, then the result is the
`double` value closest to -3\**pi*/4.
The computed result must be within 2 ulps of the exact result.
Results must be semi-monotonic.
API Note:
:   For *y* with a positive sign and finite nonzero
*x*, the exact mathematical value of `atan2` is
equal to:
- If *x* > 0, atan(abs(*y*/*x*))
- If *x* < 0, π - atan(abs(*y*/*x*))
Parameters:
:   `y` - the ordinate coordinate
:   `x` - the abscissa coordinate
Returns:
:   the *theta* component of the point
(*r*, *theta*)
in polar coordinates that corresponds to the point
(*x*, *y*) in Cartesian coordinates.
+ ### pow
public static double pow(double a,
double b)
Returns the value of the first argument raised to the power of the
second argument. Special cases:
- If the second argument is positive or negative zero, then the
result is 1.0.
- If the second argument is 1.0, then the result is the same as the
first argument.
- If the second argument is NaN, then the result is NaN.
- If the first argument is NaN and the second argument is nonzero,
then the result is NaN.
- If
* the absolute value of the first argument is greater than 1
and the second argument is positive infinity, or
* the absolute value of the first argument is less than 1 and
the second argument is negative infinity,then the result is positive infinity.
- If
* the absolute value of the first argument is greater than 1 and
the second argument is negative infinity, or
* the absolute value of the
first argument is less than 1 and the second argument is positive
infinity,then the result is positive zero.
- If the absolute value of the first argument equals 1 and the
second argument is infinite, then the result is NaN.
- If
* the first argument is positive zero and the second argument
is greater than zero, or
* the first argument is positive infinity and the second
argument is less than zero,then the result is positive zero.
- If
* the first argument is positive zero and the second argument
is less than zero, or
* the first argument is positive infinity and the second
argument is greater than zero,then the result is positive infinity.
- If
* the first argument is negative zero and the second argument
is greater than zero but not a finite odd integer, or
* the first argument is negative infinity and the second
argument is less than zero but not a finite odd integer,then the result is positive zero.
- If
* the first argument is negative zero and the second argument
is a positive finite odd integer, or
* the first argument is negative infinity and the second
argument is a negative finite odd integer,then the result is negative zero.
- If
* the first argument is negative zero and the second argument
is less than zero but not a finite odd integer, or
* the first argument is negative infinity and the second
argument is greater than zero but not a finite odd integer,then the result is positive infinity.
- If
* the first argument is negative zero and the second argument
is a negative finite odd integer, or
* the first argument is negative infinity and the second
argument is a positive finite odd integer,then the result is negative infinity.
- If the first argument is finite and less than zero
* if the second argument is a finite even integer, the
result is equal to the result of raising the absolute value of
the first argument to the power of the second argument
* if the second argument is a finite odd integer, the result
is equal to the negative of the result of raising the absolute
value of the first argument to the power of the second
argument
* if the second argument is finite and not an integer, then
the result is NaN.
- If both arguments are integers, then the result is exactly equal
to the mathematical result of raising the first argument to the power
of the second argument if that result can in fact be represented
exactly as a `double` value.
(In the foregoing descriptions, a floating-point value is
considered to be an integer if and only if it is finite and a
fixed point of the method `ceil`) or,
equivalently, a fixed point of the method `floor`). A value is a fixed point of a one-argument
method if and only if the result of applying the method to the
value is equal to the value.)
The computed result must be within 1 ulp of the exact result.
Results must be semi-monotonic.
API Note:
:   The special cases definitions of this method differ from the
special case definitions of the IEEE 754 recommended `pow` operation for ±`1.0` raised to an infinite
power. This method treats such cases as indeterminate and
specifies a NaN is returned. The IEEE 754 specification treats
the infinite power as a large integer (large-magnitude
floating-point numbers are numerically integers, specifically
even integers) and therefore specifies `1.0` be returned.
Parameters:
:   `a` - the base.
:   `b` - the exponent.
Returns:
:   the value `a``b`.
+ ### round
public static int round(float a)
Returns the closest `int` to the argument, with ties
rounding to positive infinity.
Special cases:
- If the argument is NaN, the result is 0.
- If the argument is negative infinity or any value less than or
equal to the value of `Integer.MIN_VALUE`, the result is
equal to the value of `Integer.MIN_VALUE`.
- If the argument is positive infinity or any value greater than or
equal to the value of `Integer.MAX_VALUE`, the result is
equal to the value of `Integer.MAX_VALUE`.
Parameters:
:   `a` - a floating-point value to be rounded to an integer.
Returns:
:   the value of the argument rounded to the nearest
`int` value.
+ ### round
public static long round(double a)
Returns the closest `long` to the argument, with ties
rounding to positive infinity.
Special cases:
- If the argument is NaN, the result is 0.
- If the argument is negative infinity or any value less than or
equal to the value of `Long.MIN_VALUE`, the result is
equal to the value of `Long.MIN_VALUE`.
- If the argument is positive infinity or any value greater than or
equal to the value of `Long.MAX_VALUE`, the result is
equal to the value of `Long.MAX_VALUE`.
Parameters:
:   `a` - a floating-point value to be rounded to a
`long`.
Returns:
:   the value of the argument rounded to the nearest
`long` value.
+ ### random
public static double random()
Returns a `double` value with a positive sign, greater
than or equal to `0.0` and less than `1.0`.
Returned values are chosen pseudorandomly with (approximately)
uniform distribution from that range.
When this method is first called, it creates a single new
pseudorandom-number generator, exactly as if by the expression
`new java.util.Random()`
This new pseudorandom-number generator is used thereafter for
all calls to this method and is used nowhere else.
This method is properly synchronized to allow correct use by
more than one thread. However, if many threads need to generate
pseudorandom numbers at a great rate, it may reduce contention
for each thread to have its own pseudorandom-number generator.
API Note:
:   As the largest `double` value less than `1.0`
is `Math.nextDown(1.0)`, a value `x` in the closed range
`[x1,x2]` where `x1<=x2` may be defined by the statements
```
 double f = Math.random()/Math.nextDown(1.0);
 double x = x1*(1.0 - f) + x2*f;
```
Returns:
:   a pseudorandom `double` greater than or equal
to `0.0` and less than `1.0`.

+ ### floorDiv
public static int floorDiv(int x,
int y)
Returns the largest (closest to positive infinity)
`int` value that is less than or equal to the algebraic quotient.
There is one special case: if the dividend is
Integer.MIN\_VALUE and the divisor is `-1`,
then integer overflow occurs and
the result is equal to `Integer.MIN_VALUE`.
Normal integer division operates under the round to zero rounding mode
(truncation). This operation instead acts under the round toward
negative infinity (floor) rounding mode.
The floor rounding mode gives different results from truncation
when the exact quotient is not an integer and is negative.
- If the signs of the arguments are the same, the results of
`floorDiv` and the `/` operator are the same.
For example, `floorDiv(4, 3) == 1` and `(4 / 3) == 1`.
- If the signs of the arguments are different, `floorDiv`
returns the largest integer less than or equal to the quotient
while the `/` operator returns the smallest integer greater
than or equal to the quotient.
They differ if and only if the quotient is not an integer.
For example, `floorDiv(-4, 3) == -2`,
whereas `(-4 / 3) == -1`.
Parameters:
:   `x` - the dividend
:   `y` - the divisor
Returns:
:   the largest (closest to positive infinity)
`int` value that is less than or equal to the algebraic quotient.
Throws:
:   `ArithmeticException` - if the divisor `y` is zero
+ ### floorDiv
public static long floorDiv(long x,
int y)
Returns the largest (closest to positive infinity)
`long` value that is less than or equal to the algebraic quotient.
There is one special case: if the dividend is

then integer overflow occurs and
the result is equal to `Long.MIN_VALUE`.
Normal integer division operates under the round to zero rounding mode
(truncation). This operation instead acts under the round toward
negative infinity (floor) rounding mode.
The floor rounding mode gives different results from truncation

+ ### floorMod
public static int floorMod(int x,
int y)
Returns the floor modulus of the `int` arguments.
The floor modulus is `r = x - (floorDiv(x, y) * y)`,
has the same sign as the divisor `y` or is zero, and
is in the range of `-abs(y) < r < +abs(y)`.
The relationship between `floorDiv` and `floorMod` is such that:
- `floorDiv(x, y) * y + floorMod(x, y) == x`
The difference in values between `floorMod` and the `%` operator
is due to the difference between `floorDiv` and the `/`
operator, as detailed in floorDiv(int, int)).
Examples:
- Regardless of the signs of the arguments, `floorMod`(x, y)
is zero exactly when `x % y` is zero as well.
- If neither `floorMod`(x, y) nor `x % y` is zero,
they differ exactly when the signs of the arguments differ.
* `floorMod(+4, +3) == +1`;   and `(+4 % +3) == +1`
* `floorMod(-4, -3) == -1`;   and `(-4 % -3) == -1`
* `floorMod(+4, -3) == -2`;   and `(+4 % -3) == +1`
* `floorMod(-4, +3) == +2`;   and `(-4 % +3) == -1`

is in the range of `-abs(y) < r < +abs(y)`.
The relationship between `floorDiv` and `floorMod` is such that:
- `floorDiv(x, y) * y + floorMod(x, y) == x`
For examples, see `floorMod(int, int)`).
Parameters:
:   `x` - the dividend

Returns:
:   the floor modulus `x - (floorDiv(x, y) * y)`
Throws:
:   `ArithmeticException` - if the divisor `y` is zero
+ ### floorMod
public static long floorMod(long x,
long y)
Returns the floor modulus of the `long` arguments.
The floor modulus is `r = x - (floorDiv(x, y) * y)`,

The relationship between `floorDiv` and `floorMod` is such that:
- `floorDiv(x, y) * y + floorMod(x, y) == x`
For examples, see `floorMod(int, int)`).
Parameters:
:   `x` - the dividend

+ ### ceilDiv
public static int ceilDiv(int x,

Returns the smallest (closest to negative infinity)
`int` value that is greater than or equal to the algebraic quotient.
There is one special case: if the dividend is
Integer.MIN\_VALUE and the divisor is `-1`,
then integer overflow occurs and
the result is equal to `Integer.MIN_VALUE`.
Normal integer division operates under the round to zero rounding mode
(truncation). This operation instead acts under the round toward
positive infinity (ceiling) rounding mode.
The ceiling rounding mode gives different results from truncation
when the exact quotient is not an integer and is positive.
- If the signs of the arguments are different, the results of
`ceilDiv` and the `/` operator are the same.
For example, `ceilDiv(-4, 3) == -1` and `(-4 / 3) == -1`.
- If the signs of the arguments are the same, `ceilDiv`
returns the smallest integer greater than or equal to the quotient
while the `/` operator returns the largest integer less
than or equal to the quotient.
They differ if and only if the quotient is not an integer.
For example, `ceilDiv(4, 3) == 2`,
whereas `(4 / 3) == 1`.
Parameters:
:   `x` - the dividend
:   `y` - the divisor
Returns:
:   the smallest (closest to negative infinity)
`int` value that is greater than or equal to the algebraic quotient.
Throws:
:   `ArithmeticException` - if the divisor `y` is zero
+ ### ceilDiv
public static long ceilDiv(long x,
int y)
Returns the smallest (closest to negative infinity)
`long` value that is greater than or equal to the algebraic quotient.
There is one special case: if the dividend is
Long.MIN\_VALUE and the divisor is `-1`,
then integer overflow occurs and
the result is equal to `Long.MIN_VALUE`.
Normal integer division operates under the round to zero rounding mode
(truncation). This operation instead acts under the round toward
positive infinity (ceiling) rounding mode.
The ceiling rounding mode gives different results from truncation
when the exact result is not an integer and is positive.
For examples, see `ceilDiv(int, int)`).
Parameters:
:   `x` - the dividend
:   `y` - the divisor
Returns:
:   the smallest (closest to negative infinity)
`long` value that is greater than or equal to the algebraic quotient.
Throws:
:   `ArithmeticException` - if the divisor `y` is zero

then integer overflow occurs and
the result is equal to `Long.MIN_VALUE`.

Throws:
:   `ArithmeticException` - if the divisor `y` is zero
+ ### ceilMod
public static int ceilMod(int x,
int y)
Returns the ceiling modulus of the `int` arguments.
The ceiling modulus is `r = x - (ceilDiv(x, y) * y)`,
has the opposite sign as the divisor `y` or is zero, and
is in the range of `-abs(y) < r < +abs(y)`.
The relationship between `ceilDiv` and `ceilMod` is such that:
- `ceilDiv(x, y) * y + ceilMod(x, y) == x`
The difference in values between `ceilMod` and the `%` operator
is due to the difference between `ceilDiv` and the `/`
operator, as detailed in ceilDiv(int, int)).
Examples:
- Regardless of the signs of the arguments, `ceilMod`(x, y)
is zero exactly when `x % y` is zero as well.
- If neither `ceilMod`(x, y) nor `x % y` is zero,
they differ exactly when the signs of the arguments are the same.
* `ceilMod(+4, +3) == -2`;   and `(+4 % +3) == +1`
* `ceilMod(-4, -3) == +2`;   and `(-4 % -3) == -1`
* `ceilMod(+4, -3) == +1`;   and `(+4 % -3) == +1`
* `ceilMod(-4, +3) == -1`;   and `(-4 % +3) == -1`
Parameters:
:   `x` - the dividend
:   `y` - the divisor
Returns:
:   the ceiling modulus `x - (ceilDiv(x, y) * y)`
Throws:
:   `ArithmeticException` - if the divisor `y` is zero
+ ### ceilMod

is in the range of `-abs(y) < r < +abs(y)`.
The relationship between `ceilDiv` and `ceilMod` is such that:
- `ceilDiv(x, y) * y + ceilMod(x, y) == x`
For examples, see `ceilMod(int, int)`).
Parameters:
:   `x` - the dividend
:   `y` - the divisor
Returns:
:   the ceiling modulus `x - (ceilDiv(x, y) * y)`
Throws:

long y)

+ ### abs
public static int abs(int a)
Returns the absolute value of an `int` value.
If the argument is not negative, the argument is returned.
If the argument is negative, the negation of the argument is returned.
Note that if the argument is equal to the value of `Integer.MIN_VALUE`, the most negative representable `int`
value, the result is that same value, which is negative. In
contrast, the `absExact(int)`) method throws an
`ArithmeticException` for this value.
Parameters:
:   `a` - the argument whose absolute value is to be determined
Returns:
:   the absolute value of the argument.
+ ### absExact
public static int absExact(int a)
Returns the mathematical absolute value of an `int` value
if it is exactly representable as an `int`, throwing
`ArithmeticException` if the result overflows the
positive `int` range.
Since the range of two's complement integers is asymmetric
with one additional negative value (JLS 4.2.1), the
mathematical absolute value of `Integer.MIN_VALUE`
overflows the positive `int` range, so an exception is
thrown for that argument.
Parameters:
:   `a` - the argument whose absolute value is to be determined
Returns:
:   the absolute value of the argument, unless overflow occurs
Throws:
:   `ArithmeticException` - if the argument is `Integer.MIN_VALUE`
+ ### abs
public static long abs(long a)
Returns the absolute value of a `long` value.
If the argument is not negative, the argument is returned.
If the argument is negative, the negation of the argument is returned.
Note that if the argument is equal to the value of `Long.MIN_VALUE`, the most negative representable `long`
value, the result is that same value, which is negative. In
contrast, the `absExact(long)`) method throws an
`ArithmeticException` for this value.
Parameters:
:   `a` - the argument whose absolute value is to be determined
Returns:
:   the absolute value of the argument.
+ ### absExact
public static long absExact(long a)
Returns the mathematical absolute value of an `long` value
if it is exactly representable as an `long`, throwing
`ArithmeticException` if the result overflows the
positive `long` range.
Since the range of two's complement integers is asymmetric
with one additional negative value (JLS 4.2.1), the
mathematical absolute value of `Long.MIN_VALUE` overflows
the positive `long` range, so an exception is thrown for
that argument.
Parameters:
:   `a` - the argument whose absolute value is to be determined
Returns:
:   the absolute value of the argument, unless overflow occurs
Throws:
:   `ArithmeticException` - if the argument is `Long.MIN_VALUE`

result is positive zero.
- If the argument is infinite, the result is positive infinity.
- If the argument is NaN, the result is NaN.
API Note:
:   As implied by the above, one valid implementation of
this method is given by the expression below which computes a

+ ### clamp
public static int clamp(long value,
int min,
int max)
Clamps the value to fit between min and max. If the value is less
than `min`, then `min` is returned. If the value is greater
than `max`, then `max` is returned. Otherwise, the original
value is returned.
While the original value of type long may not fit into the int type,
the bounds have the int type, so the result always fits the int type.
This allows to use method to safely cast long value to int with
saturation.
Parameters:
:   `value` - value to clamp
:   `min` - minimal allowed value
:   `max` - maximal allowed value
Returns:
:   a clamped value that fits into `min..max` interval

Throws:
:   `IllegalArgumentException` - if `min > max`
+ ### clamp
public static double clamp(double value,
double min,
double max)
Clamps the value to fit between min and max. If the value is less
than `min`, then `min` is returned. If the value is greater
than `max`, then `max` is returned. Otherwise, the original
value is returned. If value is NaN, the result is also NaN.
Unlike the numerical comparison operators, this method considers
negative zero to be strictly smaller than positive zero.
E.g., `clamp(-0.0, 0.0, 1.0)` returns 0.0.
Parameters:
:   `value` - value to clamp
:   `min` - minimal allowed value
:   `max` - maximal allowed value
Returns:
:   a clamped value that fits into `min..max` interval
Throws:

arguments is NaN, or `min > max`, or `min` is +0.0, and
`max` is -0.0.
+ ### clamp
public static float clamp(float value,
float min,
float max)
Clamps the value to fit between min and max. If the value is less
than `min`, then `min` is returned. If the value is greater
than `max`, then `max` is returned. Otherwise, the original
value is returned. If value is NaN, the result is also NaN.

+ ### fma
public static double fma(double a,
double b,
double c)
Returns the fused multiply add of the three arguments; that is,
returns the exact product of the first two arguments summed
with the third argument and then rounded once to the nearest
`double`.
The rounding is done using the [round to nearest even
rounding mode.
In contrast, if `a * b + c` is evaluated as a regular
floating-point expression, two rounding errors are involved,
the first for the multiply operation, the second for the
addition operation.
Special cases:
- If any argument is NaN, the result is NaN.
- If one of the first two arguments is infinite and the
other is zero, the result is NaN.
- If the exact product of the first two arguments is infinite
(in other words, at least one of the arguments is infinite and
the other is neither zero nor NaN) and the third argument is an
infinity of the opposite sign, the result is NaN.
Note that `fma(a, 1.0, c)` returns the same
result as (`a + c`). However,
`fma(a, b, +0.0)` does *not* always return the
same result as (`a * b`) since
`fma(-0.0, +0.0, +0.0)` is `+0.0` while
(`-0.0 * +0.0`) is `-0.0`; `fma(a, b, -0.0)` is
equivalent to (`a * b`) however.
API Note:
:   This method corresponds to the fusedMultiplyAdd
operation defined in IEEE 754.
Parameters:
:   `a` - a value
:   `b` - a value
:   `c` - a value
Returns:
:   (*a* × *b* + *c*)
computed, as if with unlimited range and precision, and rounded
once to the nearest `double` value
+ ### fma
public static float fma(float a,
float b,
float c)
Returns the fused multiply add of the three arguments; that is,
returns the exact product of the first two arguments summed
with the third argument and then rounded once to the nearest
`float`.
The rounding is done using the [round to nearest even
rounding mode.
In contrast, if `a * b + c` is evaluated as a regular
floating-point expression, two rounding errors are involved,
the first for the multiply operation, the second for the
addition operation.
Special cases:
- If any argument is NaN, the result is NaN.
- If one of the first two arguments is infinite and the
other is zero, the result is NaN.
- If the exact product of the first two arguments is infinite
(in other words, at least one of the arguments is infinite and
the other is neither zero nor NaN) and the third argument is an
infinity of the opposite sign, the result is NaN.
Note that `fma(a, 1.0f, c)` returns the same
result as (`a + c`). However,
`fma(a, b, +0.0f)` does *not* always return the
same result as (`a * b`) since
`fma(-0.0f, +0.0f, +0.0f)` is `+0.0f` while
(`-0.0f * +0.0f`) is `-0.0f`; `fma(a, b, -0.0f)` is
equivalent to (`a * b`) however.
API Note:
:   This method corresponds to the fusedMultiplyAdd
operation defined in IEEE 754.
Parameters:
:   `a` - a value
:   `b` - a value
:   `c` - a value
Returns:
:   (*a* × *b* + *c*)
computed, as if with unlimited range and precision, and rounded
once to the nearest `float` value

Special Cases:
- If the argument is NaN, then the result is NaN.
- If the argument is positive or negative infinity, then the
result is positive infinity.

+ ### ulp
public static float ulp(float f)

Returns the hyperbolic tangent of a `double` value.
The hyperbolic tangent of *x* is defined to be
(*ex - e-x*)/(*ex + e-x*),
in other words, sinh(*x*))/cosh(*x*)). Note
that the absolute value of the exact tanh is always less than
1.
Special cases:

same sign as the argument.
- If the argument is positive infinity, then the result is
`+1.0`.

The computed result must be within 2.5 ulps of the exact result.
The result of `tanh` for any finite input must have

-1.0.

public static double log1p(double x)
Returns the natural logarithm of the sum of the argument and 1.
Note that for small values `x`, the result of
`log1p(x)` is much closer to the true result of ln(1

Returns:
:   the value ln(`x` + 1), the natural
log of `x` + 1
+ ### copySign
public static double copySign(double magnitude,
double sign)
Returns the first floating-point argument with the sign of the
second floating-point argument. Note that unlike the `StrictMath.copySign`)
method, this method does not require NaN `sign`
arguments to be treated as positive values; implementations are
permitted to treat some NaN arguments as positive and other NaN
arguments as negative to allow greater performance.
API Note:
:   This method corresponds to the copySign operation defined in
IEEE 754.
Parameters:
:   `magnitude` - the parameter providing the magnitude of the result
:   `sign` - the parameter providing the sign of the result
Returns:
:   a value with the magnitude of `magnitude`
and the sign of `sign`.
+ ### copySign
public static float copySign(float magnitude,
float sign)
Returns the first floating-point argument with the sign of the
second floating-point argument. Note that unlike the `StrictMath.copySign`)
method, this method does not require NaN `sign`
arguments to be treated as positive values; implementations are
permitted to treat some NaN arguments as positive and other NaN
arguments as negative to allow greater performance.
API Note:
:   This method corresponds to the copySign operation defined in
IEEE 754.
Parameters:
:   `magnitude` - the parameter providing the magnitude of the result
:   `sign` - the parameter providing the sign of the result
Returns:
:   a value with the magnitude of `magnitude`
and the sign of `sign`.
+ ### getExponent
public static int getExponent(float f)
Returns the unbiased exponent used in the representation of a
`float`. Special cases:
- If the argument is NaN or infinite, then the result is
`Float.MAX_EXPONENT` + 1.
- If the argument is zero or subnormal, then the result is
`Float.MIN_EXPONENT` - 1.
API Note:
:   This method is analogous to the logB operation defined in IEEE
754, but returns a different value on subnormal arguments.
Parameters:
:   `f` - a `float` value
Returns:
:   the unbiased exponent of the argument
+ ### getExponent
public static int getExponent(double d)
Returns the unbiased exponent used in the representation of a
`double`. Special cases:
- If the argument is NaN or infinite, then the result is
`Double.MAX_EXPONENT` + 1.
- If the argument is zero or subnormal, then the result is
`Double.MIN_EXPONENT` - 1.
API Note:
:   This method is analogous to the logB operation defined in IEEE
754, but returns a different value on subnormal arguments.
Parameters:
:   `d` - a `double` value
Returns:
:   the unbiased exponent of the argument
+ ### nextAfter
public static double nextAfter(double start,
double direction)
Returns the floating-point number adjacent to the first
argument in the direction of the second argument. If both
arguments compare as equal the second argument is returned.
Special cases:
- If either argument is a NaN, then NaN is returned.
- If both arguments are signed zeros, `direction`
is returned unchanged (as implied by the requirement of
returning the second argument if the arguments compare as
equal).
- If `start` is
±`Double.MIN_VALUE` and `direction`
has a value such that the result should have a smaller
magnitude, then a zero with the same sign as `start`
is returned.
- If `start` is infinite and
`direction` has a value such that the result should
have a smaller magnitude, `Double.MAX_VALUE` with the
same sign as `start` is returned.
- If `start` is equal to ±
`Double.MAX_VALUE` and `direction` has a
value such that the result should have a larger magnitude, an
infinity with same sign as `start` is returned.
Parameters:
:   `start` - starting floating-point value
:   `direction` - value indicating which of
`start`'s neighbors or `start` should
be returned
Returns:
:   The floating-point number adjacent to `start` in the
direction of `direction`.
+ ### nextAfter
public static float nextAfter(float start,
double direction)
Returns the floating-point number adjacent to the first
argument in the direction of the second argument. If both
arguments compare as equal a value equivalent to the second argument
is returned.
Special cases:
- If either argument is a NaN, then NaN is returned.
- If both arguments are signed zeros, a value equivalent
to `direction` is returned.
- If `start` is
±`Float.MIN_VALUE` and `direction`
has a value such that the result should have a smaller
magnitude, then a zero with the same sign as `start`
is returned.
- If `start` is infinite and
`direction` has a value such that the result should
have a smaller magnitude, `Float.MAX_VALUE` with the
same sign as `start` is returned.
- If `start` is equal to ±
`Float.MAX_VALUE` and `direction` has a
value such that the result should have a larger magnitude, an
infinity with same sign as `start` is returned.
Parameters:
:   `start` - starting floating-point value
:   `direction` - value indicating which of
`start`'s neighbors or `start` should
be returned
Returns:
:   The floating-point number adjacent to `start` in the
direction of `direction`.
+ ### nextUp
public static double nextUp(double d)
Returns the floating-point value adjacent to `d` in
the direction of positive infinity. This method is
semantically equivalent to `nextAfter(d,

implementation may run faster than its equivalent
`nextAfter` call.
Special Cases:
- If the argument is NaN, the result is NaN.
- If the argument is positive infinity, the result is
positive infinity.
- If the argument is zero, the result is
`Double.MIN_VALUE`

+ ### scalb
public static double scalb(double d,
int scaleFactor)
Returns `d` × 2`scaleFactor`
rounded as if performed by a single correctly rounded
floating-point multiply. If the exponent of the result is
between `Double.MIN_EXPONENT` and `Double.MAX_EXPONENT`, the answer is calculated exactly. If the
exponent of the result would be larger than `Double.MAX_EXPONENT`, an infinity is returned. Note that if
the result is subnormal, precision may be lost; that is, when
`scalb(x, n)` is subnormal, `scalb(scalb(x, n),
-n)` may not equal *x*. When the result is non-NaN, the
result has the same sign as `d`.
Special cases:
- If the first argument is NaN, NaN is returned.
- If the first argument is infinite, then an infinity of the
same sign is returned.
- If the first argument is zero, then a zero of the same
