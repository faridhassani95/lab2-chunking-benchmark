# Class OutputStream
public abstract class OutputStream
extends Object
implements Closeable, Flushable
This abstract class is the superclass of all classes representing
an output stream of bytes. An output stream accepts output bytes
and sends them to some sink.
Applications that need to define a subclass of
`OutputStream` must always provide at least a method
that writes one byte of output.

Method
Description
`void`
`close()`
Closes this output stream and releases any system resources
associated with this stream.
`void`
`flush()`
Flushes this output stream and forces any buffered output bytes
to be written out.
`static OutputStream`
`nullOutputStream()`
Returns a new `OutputStream` which discards all bytes.
`void`
`write(byte[] b)`
Writes `b.length` bytes from the specified byte array
to this output stream.
`void`
`write(byte[] b,
int off,
int len)`
Writes `len` bytes from the specified byte array
starting at offset `off` to this output stream.
`abstract void`
`write(int b)`
Writes the specified byte to this output stream.

+ ### OutputStream
public OutputStream()
Constructor for subclasses to call.
+ ### nullOutputStream
public static OutputStream nullOutputStream()
Returns a new `OutputStream` which discards all bytes. The
returned stream is initially open. The stream is closed by calling
the `close()` method. Subsequent calls to `close()` have
no effect.
While the stream is open, the `write(int)`, `write(byte[])`, and `write(byte[], int, int)` methods do nothing.
After the stream has been closed, these methods all throw `IOException`.
The `flush()` method does nothing.
Returns:
:   an `OutputStream` which discards all bytes
+ ### write
public abstract void write(int b)
throws IOException
Writes the specified byte to this output stream. The general
contract for `write` is that one byte is written
to the output stream. The byte to be written is the eight
low-order bits of the argument `b`. The 24
high-order bits of `b` are ignored.
Parameters:
:   `b` - the `byte`.
Throws:
:   `IOException` - if an I/O error occurs. In particular,
an `IOException` may be thrown if the
output stream has been closed.
+ ### write
public void write(byte[] b)
throws IOException
Writes `b.length` bytes from the specified byte array
to this output stream. The general contract for `write(b)`
is that it should have exactly the same effect as the call
`write(b, 0, b.length)`.
Parameters:
:   `b` - the data.
Throws:
:   `IOException` - if an I/O error occurs.
+ ### write
public void write(byte[] b,
int off,
int len)
throws IOException
Writes `len` bytes from the specified byte array
starting at offset `off` to this output stream.
The general contract for `write(b, off, len)` is that
some of the bytes in the array `b` are written to the
output stream in order; element `b[off]` is the first
byte written and `b[off+len-1]` is the last byte written
by this operation.
If `b` is `null`, a
`NullPointerException` is thrown.
If `off` is negative, or `len` is negative, or
`off+len` is greater than the length of the array
`b`, then an `IndexOutOfBoundsException` is thrown.
API Note:
:   Subclasses are encouraged to override this method and
provide a more efficient implementation.
Implementation Requirements:
:   The `write` method of `OutputStream` calls
the write method of one argument on each of the bytes to be
written out.
Parameters:
:   `b` - the data.
:   `off` - the start offset in the data.
:   `len` - the number of bytes to write.
Throws:
:   `IOException` - if an I/O error occurs. In particular,
an `IOException` is thrown if the output
stream is closed.
:   `IndexOutOfBoundsException` - If `off` is negative,
`len` is negative, or `len` is greater than
`b.length - off`
+ ### flush
public void flush()
throws IOException
Flushes this output stream and forces any buffered output bytes
to be written out. The general contract of `flush` is
that calling it is an indication that, if any bytes previously
written have been buffered by the implementation of the output
stream, such bytes should immediately be written to their
intended destination.
If the intended destination of this stream is an abstraction provided by
the underlying operating system, for example a file, then flushing the
stream guarantees only that bytes previously written to the stream are
passed to the operating system for writing; it does not guarantee that
they are actually written to a physical device such as a disk drive.
Specified by:
:   `flush` in interface `Flushable`
Implementation Requirements:
:   The `flush` method of `OutputStream` does nothing.
Throws:
:   `IOException` - if an I/O error occurs.
+ ### close
public void close()
throws IOException
Closes this output stream and releases any system resources
associated with this stream. The general contract of `close`
is that it closes the output stream. A closed stream cannot perform
output operations and cannot be reopened.
Specified by:
:   `close` in interface `AutoCloseable`
Specified by:
:   `close` in interface `Closeable`
Implementation Requirements:
:   The `close` method of `OutputStream` does nothing.
Throws:
:   `IOException` - if an I/O error occurs.
