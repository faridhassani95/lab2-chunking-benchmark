# Class LocalDateTime
public final class LocalDateTime
extends Object
implements Temporal, TemporalAdjuster, ChronoLocalDateTime<LocalDate>, Serializable
A date-time without a time-zone in the ISO-8601 calendar system,
such as `2007-12-03T10:15:30`.
`LocalDateTime` is an immutable date-time object that represents a date-time,
often viewed as year-month-day-hour-minute-second. Other date and time fields,
such as day-of-year, day-of-week and week-of-year, can also be accessed.
Time is represented to nanosecond precision.
For example, the value "2nd October 2007 at 13:45.30.123456789" can be
stored in a `LocalDateTime`.
This class does not store or represent a time-zone.
Instead, it is a description of the date, as used for birthdays, combined with
the local time as seen on a wall clock.
It cannot represent an instant on the time-line without additional information
such as an offset or time-zone.
The ISO-8601 calendar system is the modern civil calendar system used today
in most of the world. It is equivalent to the proleptic Gregorian calendar
system, in which today's rules for leap years are applied for all time.
For most applications written today, the ISO-8601 rules are entirely suitable.
However, any application that makes use of historical dates, and requires them
to be accurate will find the ISO-8601 approach unsuitable.
This is a value-based
class; programmers should treat instances that are
equal) as interchangeable and should not
use instances for synchronization, or unpredictable behavior may
occur. For example, in a future release, synchronization may fail.
The `equals` method should be used for comparisons.
Implementation Requirements:
:   This class is immutable and thread-safe.

public static LocalDateTime from(TemporalAccessor temporal)
Obtains an instance of `LocalDateTime` from a temporal object.
This obtains a local date-time based on the specified temporal.
A `TemporalAccessor` represents an arbitrary set of date and time information,
which this factory converts to an instance of `LocalDateTime`.
The conversion extracts and combines the `LocalDate` and the
`LocalTime` from the temporal object.
Implementations are permitted to perform optimizations such as accessing
those fields that are equivalent to the relevant objects.
This method matches the signature of the functional interface `TemporalQuery`
allowing it to be used as a query via method reference, `LocalDateTime::from`.
Parameters:
:   `temporal` - the temporal object to convert, not null
Returns:
:   the local date-time, not null
Throws:
:   `DateTimeException` - if unable to convert to a `LocalDateTime`

If the field is not a `ChronoField`, then the result of this method
is obtained by invoking `TemporalField.isSupportedBy(TemporalAccessor)`
passing `this` as the argument.
Whether the field is supported is determined by the field.
Specified by:
:   `isSupported` in interface `ChronoLocalDateTime<LocalDate>`
Specified by:
:   `isSupported` in interface `TemporalAccessor`
Parameters:
:   `field` - the field to check, null returns false
Returns:
:   true if the field is supported on this date-time, false if not
+ ### isSupported
public boolean isSupported(TemporalUnit unit)
Checks if the specified unit is supported.
This checks if the specified unit can be added to, or subtracted from, this date-time.
If false, then calling the `plus(long, TemporalUnit)`) and
`minus`) methods will throw an exception.
If the unit is a `ChronoUnit` then the query is implemented here.
The supported units are:
- `NANOS`
- `MICROS`
- `MILLIS`
- `SECONDS`

+ ### range
public ValueRange range(TemporalField field)
Gets the range of valid values for the specified field.
The range object expresses the minimum and maximum valid values for a field.
This date-time is used to enhance the accuracy of the returned range.
If it is not possible to return the range, because the field is not supported
or for some other reason, an exception is thrown.
If the field is a `ChronoField` then the query is implemented here.
The `supported fields`) will return
appropriate range instances.
All other `ChronoField` instances will throw an `UnsupportedTemporalTypeException`.

+ ### get
public int get(TemporalField field)
Gets the value of the specified field from this date-time as an `int`.
This queries this date-time for the value of the specified field.
The returned value will always be within the valid range of values for the field.
If it is not possible to return the value, because the field is not supported
or for some other reason, an exception is thrown.
If the field is a `ChronoField` then the query is implemented here.
The `supported fields`) will return valid
values based on this date-time, except `NANO_OF_DAY`, `MICRO_OF_DAY`,
`EPOCH_DAY` and `PROLEPTIC_MONTH` which are too large to fit in
an `int` and throw an `UnsupportedTemporalTypeException`.
All other `ChronoField` instances will throw an `UnsupportedTemporalTypeException`.
If the field is not a `ChronoField`, then the result of this method
is obtained by invoking `TemporalField.getFrom(TemporalAccessor)`
passing `this` as the argument. Whether the value can be obtained,
and what the value represents, is determined by the field.
Specified by:
:   `get` in interface `TemporalAccessor`
Parameters:
:   `field` - the field to get, not null
Returns:
:   the value for the field
Throws:
:   `DateTimeException` - if a value for the field cannot be obtained or
the value is outside the range of valid values for the field
:   `UnsupportedTemporalTypeException` - if the field is not supported or
the range of values exceeds an `int`
:   `ArithmeticException` - if numeric overflow occurs
+ ### getLong
public long getLong(TemporalField field)

The `supported fields`) will return valid
values based on this date-time.
All other `ChronoField` instances will throw an `UnsupportedTemporalTypeException`.
If the field is not a `ChronoField`, then the result of this method
is obtained by invoking `TemporalField.getFrom(TemporalAccessor)`
passing `this` as the argument. Whether the value can be obtained,
and what the value represents, is determined by the field.

is used by calling `getMonth()`).
Returns:
:   the month-of-year, from 1 to 12
+ ### getMonth
public Month getMonth()
Gets the month-of-year field using the `Month` enum.
This method returns the enum `Month` for the month.

provides the `int value`).
Returns:
:   the month-of-year, not null
+ ### getDayOfMonth
public int getDayOfMonth()
Gets the day-of-month field.
This method returns the primitive `int` value for the day-of-month.

This includes textual names of the values.
Returns:
:   the day-of-week, not null
+ ### toLocalTime
public LocalTime toLocalTime()
Gets the `LocalTime` part of this date-time.

+ ### with
public LocalDateTime with(TemporalAdjuster adjuster)
Returns an adjusted copy of this date-time.
This returns a `LocalDateTime`, based on this one, with the date-time adjusted.
The adjustment takes place using the specified adjuster strategy object.
Read the documentation of the adjuster to understand what adjustment will be made.
A simple adjuster might simply set the one of the fields, such as the year field.
A more complex adjuster might set the date to the last day of the month.
A selection of common adjustments is provided in
`TemporalAdjusters`.
These include finding the "last day of the month" and "next Wednesday".
Key date-time classes also implement the `TemporalAdjuster` interface,
such as `Month` and `MonthDay`.
The adjuster is responsible for handling special cases, such as the varying
lengths of month and leap years.
For example this code returns a date on the last day of July:
```
import static java.time.Month.*;
import static java.time.temporal.TemporalAdjusters.*;
result = localDateTime.with(JULY).with(lastDayOfMonth());
```
The classes `LocalDate` and `LocalTime` implement `TemporalAdjuster`,
thus this method can be used to change the date, time or offset:
```
result = localDateTime.with(date);
result = localDateTime.with(time);
```
The result of this method is obtained by invoking the
`TemporalAdjuster.adjustInto(Temporal)`) method on the
specified adjuster passing `this` as the argument.
This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.
Specified by:
:   `with` in interface `ChronoLocalDateTime<LocalDate>`
Specified by:
:   `with` in interface `Temporal`
Parameters:
:   `adjuster` - the adjuster to use, not null
Returns:
:   a `LocalDateTime` based on `this` with the adjustment made, not null

:   `ArithmeticException` - if numeric overflow occurs
+ ### with
public LocalDateTime with(TemporalField field,
long newValue)
Returns a copy of this date-time with the specified field set to a new value.
This returns a `LocalDateTime`, based on this one, with the value
for the specified field changed.
This can be used to change any supported field, such as the year, month or day-of-month.
If it is not possible to set the value, because the field is not supported or for
some other reason, an exception is thrown.
In some cases, changing the specified field can cause the resulting date-time to become invalid,
such as changing the month from 31st January to February would make the day-of-month invalid.
In cases like this, the field is responsible for resolving the date. Typically it will choose
the previous valid date, which would be the last valid day of February in this example.
If the field is a `ChronoField` then the adjustment is implemented here.
The `supported fields`) will behave as per
the matching method on `LocalDate`)
or `LocalTime`).
All other `ChronoField` instances will throw an `UnsupportedTemporalTypeException`.
If the field is not a `ChronoField`, then the result of this method
is obtained by invoking `TemporalField.adjustInto(Temporal, long)`
passing `this` as the argument. In this case, the field determines
whether and how to adjust the instant.
This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.

:   a `LocalDateTime` based on this date-time with the nanoseconds subtracted, not null
Throws:
:   `DateTimeException` - if the result exceeds the supported date range
+ ### query
public <R> R query(TemporalQuery<R> query)
Queries this date-time using the specified query.
This queries this date-time using the specified query strategy object.
The `TemporalQuery` object defines the logic to be used to
obtain the result. Read the documentation of the query to understand
what the result of this method will be.
The result of this method is obtained by invoking the
`TemporalQuery.queryFrom(TemporalAccessor)`) method on the
specified query passing `this` as the argument.
Specified by:
:   `query` in interface `ChronoLocalDateTime<LocalDate>`
Specified by:
:   `query` in interface `TemporalAccessor`
Parameters:
:   `query` - the query to invoke, not null
Returns:
:   the query result, null may be returned (defined by the query)
Throws:
:   `DateTimeException` - if unable to query (defined by the query)
:   `ArithmeticException` - if numeric overflow occurs (defined by the query)
+ ### adjustInto
public Temporal adjustInto(Temporal temporal)
Adjusts the specified temporal object to have the same date and time as this object.
This returns a temporal object of the same observable type as the input
with the date and time changed to be the same as this.
The adjustment is equivalent to using `Temporal.with(TemporalField, long)`)
twice, passing `ChronoField.EPOCH_DAY` and
`ChronoField.NANO_OF_DAY` as the fields.
In most cases, it is clearer to reverse the calling pattern by using
`Temporal.with(TemporalAdjuster)`):
```
// these two lines are equivalent, but the second approach is recommended
temporal = thisLocalDateTime.adjustInto(temporal);
temporal = temporal.with(thisLocalDateTime);
```
This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.
Specified by:
:   `adjustInto` in interface `ChronoLocalDateTime<LocalDate>`
Specified by:
:   `adjustInto` in interface `TemporalAdjuster`
Parameters:
:   `temporal` - the target object to be adjusted, not null
Returns:
:   the adjusted object, not null
Throws:
:   `DateTimeException` - if unable to make the adjustment
:   `ArithmeticException` - if numeric overflow occurs
+ ### until
public long until(Temporal endExclusive,
TemporalUnit unit)
Calculates the amount of time until another date-time in terms of the specified unit.
This calculates the amount of time between two `LocalDateTime`
objects in terms of a single `TemporalUnit`.
The start and end points are `this` and the specified date-time.
The result will be negative if the end is before the start.
The `Temporal` passed to this method is converted to a
`LocalDateTime` using `from(TemporalAccessor)`).
For example, the amount in days between two date-times can be calculated
using `startDateTime.until(endDateTime, DAYS)`.
The calculation returns a whole number, representing the number of
complete units between the two date-times.
For example, the amount in months between 2012-06-15T00:00 and 2012-08-14T23:59
will only be one month as it is one minute short of two months.
There are two equivalent ways of using this method.
The first is to invoke this method.
The second is to use `TemporalUnit.between(Temporal, Temporal)`):
```
// these two lines are equivalent
amount = start.until(end, MONTHS);
amount = MONTHS.between(start, end);
```
The choice should be made based on which makes the code more readable.
The calculation is implemented in this method for `ChronoUnit`.
The units `NANOS`, `MICROS`, `MILLIS`, `SECONDS`,
`MINUTES`, `HOURS` and `HALF_DAYS`, `DAYS`,
`WEEKS`, `MONTHS`, `YEARS`, `DECADES`,
`CENTURIES`, `MILLENNIA` and `ERAS` are supported.
Other `ChronoUnit` values will throw an exception.
If the unit is not a `ChronoUnit`, then the result of this method
is obtained by invoking `TemporalUnit.between(Temporal, Temporal)`
passing `this` as the first argument and the converted input temporal
as the second argument.
This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.
Specified by:
:   `until` in interface `Temporal`
Parameters:
:   `endExclusive` - the end date, exclusive, which is converted to a `LocalDateTime`, not null
:   `unit` - the unit to measure the amount in, not null
Returns:
:   the amount of time between this date-time and the end date-time
Throws:
:   `DateTimeException` - if the amount cannot be calculated, or the end
temporal cannot be converted to a `LocalDateTime`
:   `UnsupportedTemporalTypeException` - if the unit is not supported
:   `ArithmeticException` - if numeric overflow occurs
+ ### format
public String format(DateTimeFormatter formatter)
Formats this date-time using the specified formatter.
This date-time will be passed to the formatter to produce a string.
Specified by:
:   `format` in interface `ChronoLocalDateTime<LocalDate>`
Parameters:
:   `formatter` - the formatter to use, not null
Returns:
:   the formatted date-time string, not null
Throws:
:   `DateTimeException` - if an error occurs during printing
+ ### atOffset
public OffsetDateTime atOffset(ZoneOffset offset)
Combines this date-time with an offset to create an `OffsetDateTime`.
This returns an `OffsetDateTime` formed from this date-time at the specified offset.
All possible combinations of date-time and offset are valid.
Parameters:
:   `offset` - the offset to combine with, not null
Returns:
:   the offset date-time formed from this date-time and the specified offset, not null
+ ### atZone
public ZonedDateTime atZone(ZoneId zone)
Combines this date-time with a time-zone to create a `ZonedDateTime`.
This returns a `ZonedDateTime` formed from this date-time at the
specified time-zone. The result will match this date-time as closely as possible.
Time-zone rules, such as daylight savings, mean that not every local date-time
is valid for the specified zone, thus the local date-time may be adjusted.
The local date-time is resolved to a single instant on the time-line.
This is achieved by finding a valid offset from UTC/Greenwich for the local
date-time as defined by the `rules` of the zone ID.
In most cases, there is only one valid offset for a local date-time.
In the case of an overlap, where clocks are set back, there are two valid offsets.
This method uses the earlier offset typically corresponding to "summer".
In the case of a gap, where clocks jump forward, there is no valid offset.
Instead, the local date-time is adjusted to be later by the length of the gap.
For a typical one hour daylight savings change, the local date-time will be
moved one hour later into the offset typically corresponding to "summer".
To obtain the later offset during an overlap, call
`ZonedDateTime.withLaterOffsetAtOverlap()`) on the result of this method.
To throw an exception when there is a gap or overlap, use
`ZonedDateTime.ofStrict(LocalDateTime, ZoneOffset, ZoneId)`).
Specified by:
:   `atZone` in interface `ChronoLocalDateTime<LocalDate>`
Parameters:
:   `zone` - the time-zone to use, not null
Returns:
:   the zoned date-time formed from this date-time, not null
+ ### compareTo
public int compareTo(ChronoLocalDateTime<?> other)
Compares this date-time to another date-time.
The comparison is primarily based on the date-time, from earliest to latest.
It is "consistent with equals", as defined by `Comparable`.
If all the date-times being compared are instances of `LocalDateTime`,
then the comparison will be entirely based on the date-time.
If some dates being compared are in different chronologies, then the
chronology is also considered, see `ChronoLocalDateTime.compareTo(java.time.chrono.ChronoLocalDateTime<?>)`).
Specified by:
:   `compareTo` in interface `ChronoLocalDateTime<LocalDate>`
Specified by:
:   `compareTo` in interface `Comparable<ChronoLocalDateTime<?>>`
Parameters:
:   `other` - the other date-time to compare to, not null
Returns:
:   the comparator value, that is the comparison of this local date-time with
the `other` local date-time and this chronology with the `other` chronology,
in order, returning the first non-zero result, and otherwise returning zero
+ ### isAfter
public boolean isAfter(ChronoLocalDateTime<?> other)
Checks if this date-time is after the specified date-time.
This checks to see if this date-time represents a point on the
local time-line after the other date-time.
```
LocalDate a = LocalDateTime.of(2012, 6, 30, 12, 00);
LocalDate b = LocalDateTime.of(2012, 7, 1, 12, 00);
a.isAfter(b) == false
a.isAfter(a) == false
b.isAfter(a) == true
```
This method only considers the position of the two date-times on the local time-line.
It does not take into account the chronology, or calendar system.
This is different from the comparison in `compareTo(ChronoLocalDateTime)`),
but is the same approach as `ChronoLocalDateTime.timeLineOrder()`).
Specified by:
:   `isAfter` in interface `ChronoLocalDateTime<LocalDate>`
Parameters:
:   `other` - the other date-time to compare to, not null
Returns:
:   true if this date-time is after the specified date-time
+ ### isBefore
public boolean isBefore(ChronoLocalDateTime<?> other)
Checks if this date-time is before the specified date-time.
This checks to see if this date-time represents a point on the
local time-line before the other date-time.
```
LocalDate a = LocalDateTime.of(2012, 6, 30, 12, 00);
LocalDate b = LocalDateTime.of(2012, 7, 1, 12, 00);
a.isBefore(b) == true
a.isBefore(a) == false
b.isBefore(a) == false
```
This method only considers the position of the two date-times on the local time-line.

+ ### isEqual
public boolean isEqual(ChronoLocalDateTime<?> other)
Checks if this date-time is equal to the specified date-time.
This checks to see if this date-time represents the same point on the
local time-line as the other date-time.
```
LocalDate a = LocalDateTime.of(2012, 6, 30, 12, 00);
LocalDate b = LocalDateTime.of(2012, 7, 1, 12, 00);
a.isEqual(b) == false
a.isEqual(a) == true
b.isEqual(a) == false
```

The output will be one of the following ISO-8601 formats:
- `uuuu-MM-dd'T'HH:mm`
- `uuuu-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss`
- `uuuu-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss.SSS`
- `uuuu-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss.SSSSSS`
